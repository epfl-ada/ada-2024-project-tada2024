# Your project name

This is a template repo for your project to help you organise and document your code better.
Please use this structure for your project and document the installation, usage and structure as below.

##Â Quickstart

```bash
# clone project
git clone <project link>
cd <project repo>

# install requirements
pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
```

### How to use the project

#### Semantic Scripts

Each notebook, starts with a configuration cell to define dataset directory, output directory and whether or not to download the dataset.

##### Plaintext cleaning (clean_articels.py)

This script uses the HTML files of each article to extract their plaintext and save it as a .txt file.
Specify `--download` if the dataset has never been downloaded.
```bash
python ./src/semantic/clean_articles.py --download 
```

##### Generate Embeddings (generate_embeddings.py)

In this script, given a predefined model, all plaintext articles are embedded and stored in a dictionary. Finally, the dictionary is saved locally as a .pkl file. 
```bash
python ./src/semantic/generate_embeddings.py --model_name "all_mpnet_base_v2" 
```

## Project Structure

The directory structure of new project looks like this:

```
|   .gitignore                              -> .gitignore file
|   pip_requirements.txt                    -> pip requirements of the project
|   results.ipynb                           -> final results notebook
|   
+---data                                    -> contains all the data used and generated by the project
|   +---semantic                            -> contains data realted to semantic part
|   |   \---output                          -> contains cleaned articles and embeddings
|   |       +---clean_plaintext_articles    -> contains cleansed articles generated by clean_articels.py
