€2 commemorative coins are special euro coins minted and issued by member states of the Eurozone since 2004 as legal tender in all Eurozone member states. The coins typically commemorate the anniversaries of historical events or draw attention to current events of special importance. As at 17 October 2006, twenty variations of €2 commemorative coins have been minted — six in 2004, eight in 2005 and six in 2006. One more is currently planned to be minted later in 2006. €2 commemorative coins have become collectibles.
## Regulations and restrictions
The basis for the commemorative coins derived from a decision of the European Council, which repealed the prohibition of changing the national obverse sides of euro coins from 1 January 2004 onwards. However, a number of recommendations and restrictions still apply.
Two restrictions concern the design. For one, nothing has changed about the fact that euro coins have a common reverse side, so only the national obverse sides may be changed. Additionally, the standard national obverse sides per se should not be changed before 2008 at the earliest, unless the head of state depicted on some of the coins dies before then. (This clause already came into effect for Monaco and the Vatican City , whose heads of state — Rainier III and Pope John Paul II respectively — died in 2005 and whose national obverse sides were changed for 2006.)
Further regulations restrict the frequency and number of commemorative coin issues. Each member state shall only issue one commemorative coin per year, and it shall only be denominated as a €2 coin. The total number of such coins put into circulation per year shouldn't surpass the higher of the following two numbers:
0.1 per cent of the total number of €2 coins put into circulation by all members of the eurozone. This limit can exceptionally be increased to up to 2.0 per cent if the coin commemorates a very important and noteworthy event; in this case, the member state issuing this higher number of coins should refrain from putting any commemorative coins into circulation for the following four years.
5.0 per cent of the total number of €2 coins put into circulation by the member state issuing the €2 commemorative coin.
Another decision added two more guidelines regarding the design of the coins. The state issuing a coin should in some way clearly be identified on the obverse side, either by stating the full name or a clearly identifiable abbreviation of it; and neither name nor the denomination of the coin should be repeated on the obverse, as it is already featured on the common reverse side.
These restrictions do not apply retroactively; only new designs — the national obverse sides for regular issues of states newly joining the euro or of eurozone states which change their design, and €2 commemorative coins issued from 2006 onwards — are subject to them.
## Issues
As of February 2006, ten countries have issued €2 commemorative coins ( Austria , Belgium , Finland , Germany , Greece , Italy , Luxembourg , San Marino , Spain and the Vatican City ), with Greece being the first country to issue this type of coin. Five eurozone countries have not yet issued such coins ( France , Ireland , Monaco , the Netherlands and Portugal ).
The face value of the coins is typically less than their intrinsic value of between €3 and €12. The exceptions are San Marino and the Vatican City, where coins from the former are regularly sold for between €30 and €40, while coins from the latter are very rarely obtained for less than €100.
Issued designs are made public in the Official Journal of the European Union (references to these publications are given in the tables below).
Note : In heraldry , directions are often described as they would appear to the bearer of a coat of arms, rather than as they would appear to the viewer. Therefore, the following descriptions will use "facing to the left" when it would appear to the layman that the person depicted is facing to the right.
### 2004 coinage
### 2005 coinage
### 2006 coinage
Six €2 commemorative coins have been released in 2006 as at 17 October 2006, and one more state has announced it will do so over the course of the year. The Vatican City is going to issue its third coin, commemorating the 500 th anniversary of the Swiss Guard, on 9 November 2006 .
### 2007 coinage
Apart from the second coin of the German Bundesländer series, there are plans for a common €2 commemorative coin issued by all thirteen member states of the eurozone to be issued in March, commemorating the 50 th anniversary of the signature of the Treaties of Rome. Furthermore, Portugal will issue their first coin to commemorate their presidency of the Council of the European Union and San Marino will issue their fourth coin in September to commemorate Giuseppe Garibaldi's 200 th birthday.
### German Bundesländer series
Germany started the commemorative coin series Die 16 Bundesländer der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (The 16 States of the Federal Republic of Germany) in 2006, which will continue until 2021. The year in which the coin for a specific state is issued coincides with that state's Presidency of the Bundesrat . The first coin was issued in 2006:
The other fifteen coins will be issued in the following years; note that some designs are not yet finalised and still subject to change. (Originally, the designs for Hamburg and Bavaria were to be the Landungsbrücken ( German Wikipedia article ) and the Munich Frauenkirche, respectively.)
The series is similar to the United States ' State Quarters series, which issues coin at shorter intervals and will continue until 2008, having started in 1999; the longer timespan and shorter intervals are a consequence of the larger number of states (currently fifty).
