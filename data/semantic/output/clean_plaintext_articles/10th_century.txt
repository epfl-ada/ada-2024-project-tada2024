As a means of recording the passage of time , the 10th century was that century which lasted from 901 to 1000.
## Overview
The tenth century is usually regarded as a low point in European history. In China it was also a period of political upheaval. In Islamdom, however, it was a cultural zenith, especially in Spain.
Medievalist and historian of technology Lynn White said that "to the modern eye, it is very nearly the darkest of the Dark Ages ," but concluded that ". . . if it was dark, it was the darkness of the womb." Similarly, Helen Waddell wrote that the tenth century was that which "in the textbooks disputes with the seventh the bad eminence, the nadir of the human intellect." Even in the fifteenth century, Lorenzo Valla described it as the Century of Lead and Iron .
