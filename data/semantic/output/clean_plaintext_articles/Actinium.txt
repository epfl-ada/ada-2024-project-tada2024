Actinium ( IPA: /akˈtɪniəm/ ) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Ac and atomic number 89.
## Notable characteristics
Actinium is a silvery radioactive metallic element. Due to its intense radioactivity, Actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light. It is found only in traces in uranium ores as 227 Ac, an α and β emitter with a half-life of 21.773 years. One ton of uranium ore contains about a tenth of a gram of actinium.
## Applications
It is about 150 times as radioactive as radium, making it valuable as a neutron source. Otherwise it has no significant industrial applications.
225 Ac is used in medicine to produce 213 Bi in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radio-immunotherapy.
## History
Actinium was discovered in 1899 by André-Louis Debierne, a French chemist, who separated it from pitchblende. Friedrich Otto Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902. The chemical behaviour of actinium is similar to that of the rare earth lanthanum .
The word actinium comes from the Greek aktis, aktinos , meaning beam or ray.
## Occurrence
Actinium is found in trace amounts in uranium ore, but more commonly is made in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of 226 Ra in a nuclear reactor. Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor at about 1100 to 1300ºC.
## Isotopes
Naturally occurring actinium is composed of 1 radioactive isotope; 227 Ac. 36 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 227 Ac with a half-life of 21.772 y, 225 Ac with a half-life of 10.0 days , and 226 Ac with a half-life of 29.37 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 10 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute. The shortest-lived isotope of actinium is 217 Ac which decays through alpha decay and electron capture. It has a half-life of 69 ns. Actinium also has 2 meta states.
Purified 227 Ac comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days, and then decays according to its 21.773-year half-life.
The isotopes of actinium range in atomic weight from 206 amu ( 206 Ac) to 236 amu ( 236 Ac).
## Precautions
227 Ac is extremely radioactive, and in terms of its potential for radiation induced health effects, 227 Ac is even more dangerous than plutonium . Ingesting even small amounts of 227 Ac would present a serious health hazard.
