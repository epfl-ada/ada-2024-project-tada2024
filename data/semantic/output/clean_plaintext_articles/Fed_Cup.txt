The Fed Cup (until 1995 Federation Cup ) is the most important tennis tournament for female national teams, very similar to the men's Davis Cup . Both events are sanctioned by the International Tennis Federation. The chief difference between the 2 events used to be that the Fed Cup was typically contested in a much shorter period of time (2 weeks or less) whereas the Davis Cup is staggered over many months. Recently the format of the Fed Cup has been modified along the lines of the Davis Cup with one notable difference: each tie extends for only two days with doubles being the last rubber.
The event was first held in 1963, the 50th anniversary of ITF, and has been held annually ever since.
Arantxa Sánchez Vicario of Spain currently holds the record for the most singles and doubles wins in Fed Cup competition with 72 total victories and most years played (17). Israel 's Anna Smashnova holds the records for most ties played (59)
