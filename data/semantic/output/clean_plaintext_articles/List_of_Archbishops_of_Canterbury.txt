This is a list of the Archbishops of Canterbury . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the established Church of England and of the worldwide Anglican Communion .
Until the first break between the Church of England and the Papal authority in 1534, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church , which selected and consecrated them. After this the full communion was restored but then finally broken nearly 40 years later by the excommunication of Elizabeth I on April 27, 1570. Since 1570, the Archbishop has been selected by the English (latterly British) monarch. Today, the choice is made in the name of the Sovereign by the Prime Minister , from a shortlist of two selected by an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.
Today, the Archbishop fills four main roles:
He is the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury, which covers the east of the County of Kent and the extreme north-east of Surrey. Founded by Augustine in 597, it is the oldest bishopric in the English church.
He is the metropolitan of the Province of Canterbury, encompassing 30 dioceses in the southern two-thirds of England . The remaining 14 dioceses in the north of England fall within the Province of York, under the aegis of the Archbishop of York. Four dioceses in Wales were under the Province of Canterbury until they were transferred to the disestablished Church in Wales in 1920.
As "Primate of All England", he is the chief religious figure in the Church of England (the British sovereign is the " Supreme governor" of the church).
As symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, the archbishop is recognized as primus inter pares ("first among equals") of all Anglican primates.
