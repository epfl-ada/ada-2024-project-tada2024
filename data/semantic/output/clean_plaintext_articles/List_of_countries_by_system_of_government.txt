This is a list of countries categorized by system of government.
## Presidential / Separated republics
Where a president is the active head of the executive branch of government and is independent from the legislature. The following list includes democratic and non-democratic states:
### Full presidential systems
In full presidential systems, the president is both head of state and head of government. There is no prime minister.
### Semi-presidential systems
In semi-presidential systems, there is a president and a prime minister. In such systems, the President has genuine executive authority, unlike in a parliamentary republic, but some of the role of a head of government is exercised by the prime minister.
## Parliamentary republics
Where a prime minister is the active head of the executive branch of government and also leader of the legislature. However, there is also a president who serves as a symbolic head of state in some figurehead capacity. The following list includes democratic and non-democratic states:
## Absolute monarchies
Monarchies in which the monarch is the active head of the executive branch and exercises all powers.
## Constitutional monarchies
Where a prime minister is the active head of the executive branch of government and also leader of the legislature. The head of state is a constitutional monarch who only exercises his or her powers with the consent of the government and is largely a figurehead.
### Semi-constitutional monarchies
The prime minister (or equivalent) is the nation's active executive, but the monarch still has considerable political powers that can be used at his/her own independent discretion.
### Commonwealth realms
Constitutional monarchies, in which Queen Elizabeth II serves as head of state over an independent government. In each Realm, she acts as the monarch of that state, and is usually titled accordingly - for example, Queen of Australia. The Queen appoints a Governor-General to each country other than the United Kingdom to act as her representative. The prime minister is the active head of the executive branch of government and also leader of the legislature.
## Theocracies
Non-democratic states based on a state religion where the head of state is selected by some form of religious hierarchy.
Iran
the Holy See ( Vatican City )
## One-party states
Non-democratic states in which political power is concentrated within a single political party whose operations are largely fused with the government hierarchy.
## Military junta states
The nation's armed forces control the organs of government and all high-ranking political executives are also members of the military hierarchy.

Mauritania
Myanmar
Pakistan
Sudan
Thailand
## Transitional
States which have a system of government which is in transition or turmoil and cannot be accurately classified.
