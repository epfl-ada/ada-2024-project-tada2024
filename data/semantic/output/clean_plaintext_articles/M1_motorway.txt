The M1 is a major north-south motorway in England connecting London to Yorkshire, where it joins the A1(M) near Aberford. While the M1 is considered to be the first inter-urban motorway to be completed in the United Kingdom , the first road to be built to motorway standard in the country was the Preston Bypass, which later became part of the M6 .
The motorway is 193 miles (310 km) long and was constructed in four phases; the majority of the motorway was opened in 1959 and between 1965 and 1968. The two ends of the motorway were extended later; the southern end in 1977 and the northern end in 1999.
It forms part of the unsigned European route E13.
## History
### First Section, 1959
The first section of the motorway opened between junction 5 ( Watford) and junction 18 ( Crick/ Rugby) on 2 November 1959 together with the motorway's two spurs, the M10 (from junction 7 to St Albans) and the M45 (from junction 17 to the A45 and Coventry ).
This section of the M1 broadly follows the route of the A5 north-west. It started at the Watford Bypass ( A41), which runs south-east to meet the A1 at Apex corner, and ended on the A5 at Crick. The M10 spur motorway connected the M1 to the North Orbital Road ( A405/ A414, a precursor of the M25 ) where it also meet the A5 (now renumbered here as the A5183) and, two miles to the east via the A414, to the A6 (also renumbered as the A1081).
### Rugby to Leeds, 1965 to 1968
The continuation of the motorway from junction 18 towards Yorkshire was carried out as a series of extensions between 1965 and 1968. Diverging from the A5, the motorway takes a more northerly route through the East Midlands, via Leicester , Loughborough, Nottingham to Sheffield where the M18 splits from the M1 at junction 32 to head to Doncaster.
Originally, the M1 was planned to end at Doncaster; however, it was decided to make what was going to be the " Leeds and Sheffield Spur", the primary route with the 11 mile section to the A1(M) south of Doncaster given a separate motorway number.
From junction 32, the motorway passes between Sheffield and Rotherham, passes to the west of Barnsley and Wakefield and reaches the original end of the motorway at junction 44 to the east of Leeds. There were plans to route the M1 from just south of junction 42 where it interchanges with the M62, round the west of Leeds to the A1 at Dishforth; however the existing route to the east of Leeds was selected. With the M62 and M621, the M1 forms a ring of motorways around Leeds.
### Leeds South Eastern Urban Motorway, 1972
In 1972 an extension of the M1 was opened into central Leeds over as the Leeds South Eastern Motorway where it met the Leeds South Western Motorway (M621) coming north-east from the M62 at junction 3.
### Leeds to Hook Moor, 1999
Between 1996 and 1999 the M1 section north of the M62 underwent a major reconstruction and extension to take the M1 on a new route to the A1(M) at Aberford. The new road involved the construction of a series of new junctions, bridges and viaducts to the east of Leeds. When the new section of M1 was completed and opened in 1999, the Leeds South Eastern Motorway section of the M1 was redesignated as the M621 and the junctions were given new numbers (M621 junctions 4 to 7).
### London extensions, 1966, 1967 and 1977
The M1 was extended south from its original starting point at junction 5 towards London in three stages. The first stage, opened in 1966, took the motorway south-east, parallel to the A41 to meet the A5 at junction 4 south of Elstree. The second phase continued east to Scratchwood (where the London Gateway Service Area occupies the location of the missing junction 3 from where an unbuilt spur would have connected to the A1 at Stirling Corner), then south to run alongside the Midland Main Line towards Hendon where it meets the A1 again at junction 2 via a tightly curved flyover section.
The current junction 2 is about 600 metres south of the original junction. Southbound traffic originally left the motorway via a slip road which passed under the A1 Barnet Bypass and looped round to join it. The northbound slip road from the A1 is now partially used as the entrance way to a business park but no longer reaches the northbound carriageway as it is cut off by the motorway continuing south.
The final section of the M1 was opened to junction 1 at Staples Corner in 1977. There the motorway meets the North Circular Road (A406) at a grade separated junction and roundabout. Plans made in the 1960s would have seen the motorway continue through the junction on an elevated roadway to end at West Hampstead where it would have met the North Cross Route, the northern section of the London Motorway Box, a proposed ring of urban motorway around the central area. The layout of the Staples Corner junction was originally built in accordance with these plans although most of the London Ringways Plan had been cancelled by 1973.
## Trivia
The first motorway service station in the UK was built at Watford Gap and later immortalised in song by Roy Harper.
