Neon ( IPA: /ˈniːɒn/ ) is the chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Ne and atomic number 10. A colorless, nearly inert noble gas, neon gives a distinct reddish glow when used in vacuum discharge tubes and neon lamps and is found in air in trace amounts.
## Notable characteristics
Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, glows reddish- orange in a vacuum discharge tube and has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis). In most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium. Neon has the most intense discharge at normal voltages and currents of all the rare gases.
## Applications
The reddish-orange colour that neon emits in neon lights is widely used to make advertising signs and is also used in long tubular strips in car modification. The word "neon" is also used generically for these types of lights even though many other gases are used to produce different colors of light. Other uses:
vacuum tubes
high-voltage indicators
lightning arrestors
wave meter tubes
television tubes
Neon and helium are used to make a type of gas laser
Liquefied neon is commercially used as a cryogenic refrigerant in applications not requiring the lower temperature range attainable with more expensive liquid helium refrigeration.
## History
Neon ( Greek νέος meaning "new") was discovered by Scottish chemist William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers in 1898.
## Occurrence
Neon is a monatomic gas at standard conditions. Neon is rare, found in the Earth's atmosphere at 1 part in 65,000 and industrially produced by cryogenic fractional distillation of liquified air.
## Compounds
The ions, Ne + , (Ne Ar ) + , (Ne H ) + , and ( He Ne + ), have been observed from optical and mass spectrometric research. In addition, neon forms an unstable hydrate.
## Isotopes
Neon has three stable isotopes: 20 Ne (90.48%), 21 Ne (0.27%) and 22 Ne (9.25%). 21 Ne and 22 Ne are nucleogenic and their variations are well understood. In contrast, 20 Ne is not known to be nucleogenic and the causes of its variation in the Earth have been hotly debated. The principal nuclear reactions which generate neon isotopes are neutron emission, alpha decay reactions on 24 Mg and 25 Mg, which produce 21 Ne and 22 Ne, respectively. The alpha particles are derived from uranium -series decay chains, while the neutrons are mostly produced by secondary reactions from alpha particles. The net result yields a trend towards lower 20 Ne/ 22 Ne and higher 21 Ne/ 22 Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites . Isotopic analysis of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic production of 21 Ne. This isotope is generated by spallation reactions on magnesium , sodium , silicon , and aluminium . By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surficial rocks and meteorites.
Similar to xenon , neon content observed in samples of volcanic gases are enriched in 20 Ne, as well as nucleogenic 21 Ne, relative to 22 Ne content. The neon isotopic content of these mantle-derived samples represent a non-atmospheric source of neon. The 20 Ne-enriched components are attributed to exotic primordial rare gas components in the Earth, possibly representing solar neon. Elevated 20 Ne abundances are also found in diamonds , further suggesting a solar neon reservoir in the Earth.
