The large version of the periodic table set out below does not fit into some computer screens; however, with a small font size and/or in landscape mode, it may be possible to print this periodic table on one or two normal-size sheets of paper. The key below explains the colour-coding and layout of each entry.
† A value in brackets, such as [259.1011], is the atomic weight of the most stable isotope unless it is an integer, in which case it is the mass number of the most stable isotope. In all other cases, the value is the mean atomic weight of the most stable isotopic composition, according to Atomic Weights of the Elements 2001, and includes its uncertainty in parenthesis. For example, the value of 1.00794(7) for hydrogen means that the most stable isotopic composition of hydrogen has an atomic weight of 1.00794 atomic mass units (amu) with one standard deviation uncertainty of 0.00007 amu.
‡ These atomic masses are only estimates, as these elements have not yet been discovered.
