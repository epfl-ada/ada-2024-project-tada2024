Protactinium ( IPA: /ˌprəʊˌtakˈtɪniəm/ ) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Pa and atomic number 91.
## Notable Characteristics
Protactinium is a silver metallic element that belongs to the actinide group, with a bright metallic luster that it retains for some time in the air. It is superconductive at temperatures below 1.4 K.
## Applications
Due to its scarcity, high radioactivity and toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of basic scientific research.
Protactinium-231, which is formed by the alpha decay of Uranium-235, could possibly sustain a nuclear chain reaction and might, in principle, be used to build a nuclear weapon. The critical mass, according to Walter Seifritz, is 750±180 kg. Other authors conclude that no chain reactions are possible in Protactinium-231.
## History
Protactinium was first identified in 1913, when Kasimir Fajans and O. H. Göhring encountered short-lived isotope 234m-Pa, with a half-life of about 1.17 minutes, during their studies of the decay chain of 238-U. They gave the new element the name Brevium ( Latin brevis , brief, short); the name was changed to Protoactinium in 1918 when two groups of scientists ( Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of the UK ) independently discovered 231-Pa, and shortened to Protactinium in 1949.
Aristid V. Grosse prepared 2 mg of Pa 2 O 5 in 1927, and later on managed to isolate Protactinium for the first time in 1934 from 0.1 mg of Pa 2 O 5 , first converting the oxide to an iodide and then cracking it in a high vacuum by an electrically heated filament by the reaction 2PaI 5 → 2Pa + 5I 2 .
In 1961, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority was able to produce 125 g of 99.9% pure protactinium, processing 60 tons of waste material in a 12-stage process and spending 500,000 USD; this was the world's only supply of the element for many years to come, and it is reported that the metal was sold to laboratories for a cost of 2,800 USD / g in the following years.
## Biological Role
Protactinium does not play any biological role.
## Occurrence
Protactinium occurs in pitchblende to the extent of about 1 part 231 Pa to 10 million of ore. Some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm.

## Isotopes
29 radioisotopes of protactinium have been characterized, with the most stable being 231-Pa with a half life of 32760 years, 233-Pa with a half-life of 26.967 days, and 230-Pa with a half-life of 17.4 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 1.6 days, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1.8 seconds. This element also has 2 meta states, 217m-Pa (t ½ 1.15 milliseconds) and 234m-Pa (t ½ 1.17 minutes).
The primary decay mode before the most stable isotope, 231-Pa, is alpha decay and the primary mode after is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before 231-Pa are element Ac ( actinium ) isotopes and the primary products after are element U ( uranium ) isotopes.
## Precautions
Protactinium is both toxic and highly radioactive. It requires precautions similar to those used when handling plutonium .
