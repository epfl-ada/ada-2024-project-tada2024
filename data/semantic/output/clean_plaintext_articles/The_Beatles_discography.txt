The Beatles released twelve albums (thirteen if The White Album is counted twice) in seven years. Their discography is complicated due to different U.S. and UK releases, particularly in their early years at Capitol.
## Historical background
The first four Beatles vinyl albums differ based on their location of release. Those released in the U.S. were of lower sound quality and had some of their songs omitted. Additionally, even though the first four Beatles albums were originally released as both monaural and stereo recordings in the United Kingdom , stereo record players were quite rare in the UK at the time. Naturally, then, George Martin and The Beatles only spent a lot of time on the mono mixes. Many early songs were later remastered by Capitol Records for the U.S. as artificial stereo with bass on one side and treble on the other side, with lots of added echo. However, this was only done when the stereo mix of the song was not available or did not exist, as in the case of She Loves You. The Capitol release of Rubber Soul , however, has gained a lot of fans in the years since the release of the British albums on CD. The additions of "I've Just Seen a Face" and "It's Only Love" from "Help!" and the omission of "Drive my Car," "Nowhere Man," "What Goes On," and "If I Needed Someone" gives the album a different, folky flavour.
When it came time to release The Beatles' catalogue on CD , the decision was made to use the original British versions of the albums, since those were the "way The Beatles originally intended them to be". The initial releases of the first four CDs were of the original mono mixes. In 2004, Capitol Records released the first four American albums on CD as a box set and they represent the current (as of 2006) official stereo versions. No official stereo mix of the first four British albums had been released on compact disc, but there were plenty of "official looking" bootleg CDs in circulation that include the U.S. stereo mixes and even bear the " Apple" logo. Martin and The Beatles started to spend more time on stereo mixes by 1965. However, many fans believe that the mono versions of Revolver , Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , and the so-called White Album are superior to the stereo mixes.
As of 2006, many Beatles enthusiasts feel that the current EMI CD releases of the albums do not do them justice. The music was mastered to be played on vinyl, the cutting and playback of which is widely believed to add 'warmth' to the recording, and the CDs, produced during the early days of the format, do not compensate for the different medium. Given how important the sound quality of these albums was not only to The Beatles and George Martin, but also from a historical point of view, many purists still listen to The Beatles albums only on vinyl.

The Beatles also recorded annual Christmas records for their fan club members. From 1963 to 1969 these were released as 7" flexidiscs on LYN. In 1970 the 7 previous records were put onto a 12" vinyl record. These remain largely unavailable today, with the exception of one track, "Christmas Time Is Here Again", which was edited and released on the Free As a Bird CD single in 1994:

## In Canada
The division of Capitol Records in Canada released three albums and a number of singles in 1963 and 1964 before aligning with the American division and releasing the same albums as in the U.S. Unlike the U.S., Capitol of Canada said yes to The Beatles from day one, as many British artists had obtained hit records in Canada previously, unlike in the USA. The first Canadian release was " Love Me Do" on 1963- 02-04.

## In the U.S.
In the United States , as noted above, The Beatles albums were rearranged, retitled and remixed. Some of the U.S. releases were nearly identical to their UK counterparts, often only varying by one or two songs. Most releases contained songs that were also found on other records, which made things difficult for the American Beatles fan trying to purchase the band's entire catalog. By 1967, all U.S. releases matched the UK releases exactly. Some of the U.S. releases included:
