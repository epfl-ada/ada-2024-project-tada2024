The Oz books form a book series that begins with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , and that relates the "history" of the Land of Oz. Oz was originally created by author L. Frank Baum, who went on to write fourteen Oz books. Although most of the Oz books are strictly adventures, Baum—as well as many later Oz authors—styled themselves as "Royal Historians" of Oz. Later authors wrote 26 other "official" books after Baum's death. Many other authors have put their own twists on Oz, notably Gregory Maguire's revisionist Wicked .
## Background
The first fourteen books by the original author, L. Frank Baum, another nineteen by Ruth Plumly Thompson, and another seven books by various other authors comprise the "Famous Forty", which is considered the classic original series (though many inconsistencies make it difficult to call it canonical). Most of the books in the "Famous Forty" were published by Reilly and Britton (later Reilly and Lee).
Other books were printed later, by different publishing houses. As the earlier works have fallen out of copyright into the public domain (including all of L. Frank Baum's titles), numerous other books have been written in the series by many authors and publishers, some of whom continue to publish new works today.
In fact, so many additional Oz books have been written, that merely attempting to document all such books is a weighty endeavor in and of itself (see: External links). Some small publishers have even specialised in publishing Oz pastiches, of which the most commercial are probably Books of Wonder, Hungry Tiger Press, and The International Wizard of Oz Club—and perhaps the graphic novels of Eric Shanower. There are also alternative series of Oz books, such as the sequels written in Russian by Alexander M. Volkov, or the books of Frank Baum's great-grandson, Roger S. Baum. Then there are the "revisionist" books of Gregory Maguire. The following list therefore contains Oz books written by the authors of the first "Famous Forty" (including those published in later years). Others, including Volkov and Maguire's are listed below.
## List of "canonical" Oz books ("The Famous Forty")
### By L. Frank Baum
Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.
### By Ruth Plumly Thompson
Thompson's style was markedly different from Baum's. Her tales harkened back to more traditional fairytales. She often included a small kingdom, a prince or princess who saves his or her kingdom and regains the throne or saves Oz from invasion. Thompson even respelled Baum's respelling " Nome" as the more traditional " Gnome". All in all Thompson wrote 19 Oz books, five more than Baum.
### By other writers
When Thompson retired in 1939 longtime Oz illustrator John R. Neill took over the series and wrote three more of the "Famous Forty". Neill's vision of Oz is more manic than Thompson or Baum's. Houses often get up and do battle, and everything can be alive. His entries take Oz's colour scheme (blue for Munchkin Country, red for Quadling Country, etc.) to an extreme, extending it to sky and skin colors.
Jack Snow was a Baum scholar, and even offered to take over the series at age twelve when Baum died. Snow's books lack any characters created by Thompson or Neill, although he did create his own.
## Non-canonical Oz works by "Royal Historians"
Each of the "Royal Historians" wrote Oz-related works not generally considered canonical. Some are short stories, some are reference works, still others are novels written sometimes years after the authors' main body of Oz books.
Baum also wrote Oz-related stage plays: The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1901) with music by Paul Tietjens and Nathaniel D. Mann, The Wizard of Oz (1902) (music by Tietjens et al; with jokes by Glen MacDonough), The Woggle-Bug (1905) with music by Frederick Chapin, The Rainbow's Daughter, or The Magnet of Love (February 1909) with music by Manuel Klein, revised in April 1909 as Ozma of Oz , and ultimately produced, with music by Louis F. Gottschalk as The Tik-Tok Man of Oz . Also in 1909, he wrote a play called The Girl from Oz . The manuscript is held in the archives at Syracuse University, but apparently its relation to Oz is little more than nominal (it is also known as The Girl from Tomorrow and was later adapted for radio by Frank Joslyn Baum, as is also the case with the short story, "The Littlest Giant", a rather brutal tale designated in two lines to be in the Gillikin country of Oz. With Gottschalk writing the music, he wrote an unproduced stage version of The Patchwork Girl of Oz in November 1913, that was developed into the film scenario.
## Alternate Oz
Below are some books which deal with alternate views of Oz, and are usually considered apocryphal. Because there are literally hundreds of unofficial Oz books, the following is a list of those that are best-known, or most independently or commercially successful.
