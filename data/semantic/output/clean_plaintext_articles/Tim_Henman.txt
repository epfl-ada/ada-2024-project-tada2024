Timothy Henry Henman , OBE (born 6 September 1974 in Oxford ) is an English tennis player.
He is the first player from the United Kingdom since Roger Taylor in the 1970s to reach the semi-finals of the Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship, and prior to the emergence of Andy Murray was regarded by his fans (whose devotion is known as "Henmania") as the UK's only hope of winning the tournament, a feat last achieved by Fred Perry in 1936.
## Early life
Henman was educated at Dragon School and Reed's School. He comes from a sporting family: his father was accomplished at various sports, including tennis. His grandfather and great-grandfather also competed at Wimbledon. Henman supports Oxford United Football Club and is a keen golfer.
Between the ages of 10 and 17 he was a member of the David Lloyd Slater Squad , where he trained alongside a number of other young British tennis hopefuls. Henman won many titles at many different places some as smaller places as Ilkleys tennis club
While still at school, Henman was diagnosed with osteochondritis, a bone disease (one form of chondritis). However, he kept playing tennis, and in 1992 won the National Junior titles in singles and doubles, deciding to join the professional tour in 1993.

## Professional career
He climbed up the ranks very quickly: in 1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by 1995, among the top 100; and by 1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the Atlanta Olympics. He was the UK's highest ranked player that year, and won the Most Improved Player trophy at the ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January 1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months.
In 1998, the year in which he reached Wimbledon's semi-finals for the first time, he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. In 1999, Henman married his long-term girlfriend, TV producer Lucy Heald.
"Tiger Tim" - as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon diehards (many of whom assemble on Henman Hill, unofficially named for their hero) - has come close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, bowing out during the semi-final in 1998, 1999, 2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and 2002. In 2000 he reached the fourth round and in 1996, 1997, 2003 and 2004 he was ousted during the quarter-finals.
One of the tournaments he has been most successful in is Queen's Club. He reached the final in 1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras , and went on to reach the final again in 2001 and 2002, where both times he lost to Lleyton Hewitt.
2001 was Tim's best Wimbledon year. He beat Roger Federer in 4 sets during the quarterfinal and gained a lot of confidence coming into the semis since the latter just took out defending champion Pete Sampras . Tim faced three-time finalist Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back. Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.
In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in Paris against Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat Roger Federer and Andy Roddick on his way to the final.
Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round match at the French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament favorite and runner-up Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few months later, at the US Open, losing to eventual champion Roger Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup .

In the 2004 Summer Olympics tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.
In 2005, he lost in straight sets to Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open . This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the French Open and Wimbledon . In France, he lost in four sets to Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to Fernando Verdasco.
Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006 The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.
Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.
Henman was created an OBE in the 2003 New Year's Honours List.
In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.
Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in Indian Wells Masters and Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them.
