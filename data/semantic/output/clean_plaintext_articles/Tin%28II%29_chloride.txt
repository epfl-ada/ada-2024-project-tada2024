Tin(II) chloride (stannous chloride) is a white crystalline solid with the formula Sn Cl 2 . It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, particularly if hot. SnCl 2 is widely used as a reducing agent (in acid solution), and in electrolytic baths for tin-plating. Tin(II) chloride should not be confused with the other chloride of tin; tin(IV) chloride or stannic chloride (SnCl 4 ).
## Structure
SnCl 2 has a lone pair, such that the molecule in the gas phase is bent. In the solid state, crystalline SnCl 2 forms chains linked via chloride bridges as shown. The dihydrate is also three-coordinate, with one water coordinated on to the tin, and a second water coordinated to the first. The main part of the molecule stacks into double layers in the crystal lattice, with the "second" water sandwiched between the layers.
## Chemical properties
Tin(II) chloride can dissolve in less than its own mass of water without apparent decomposition, but as the solution is diluted hydrolysis occurs to form an insoluble basic salt:
Therefore if clear solutions of tin(II) chloride are to be used, hydrochloric acid must be added in order to maintain the equilibrium towards the left-hand side (using Le Chatelier's principle). Solutions of SnCl 2 are also unstable towards oxidation by the air:
6 SnCl 2 ( aq) + O 2 ( g ) + 2 Water (molecule)( l) → 2 SnCl 4 (aq) + 4 Sn(OH)Cl(Solid|s)
This can be prevented by storing the solution over lumps of tin metal.
There are many such cases where tin(II) chloride acts as a reducing agent, reducing silver and gold salts to the metal, and iron(III) salts to iron(II), for example:
SnCl 2 (aq) + 2 FeCl 3 (aq) → SnCl 4 (aq) + 2 FeCl 2 (aq)
Solutions of tin(II) chloride can also serve simply as a source of Sn 2+ ions, which can form other tin(II) compounds via precipitation reactions, for example brown (or black) tin(II) sulfide:
SnCl 2 (aq) + Na 2 S(aq) → SnS(s) + 2 NaCl(aq)
If alkali is added to a solution of SnCl 2 , a white precipitate of hydrated tin(II) oxide forms initially; this then dissolves in excess base to form a stannite salt such as sodium stannite:
SnCl 2 (aq) + 2 NaOH (aq) → SnO·H 2 O(s) + 2 NaCl(aq)
SnO·H 2 O(s) + NaOH(aq) → NaSn(OH) 3 (aq)
Anhydrous SnCl 2 can be used to make a variety of interesting tin(II) compounds in non-aqueous solvents. For example, the lithium salt of 4-methyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol reacts with SnCl 2 in THF to give the yellow linear two-coordinate compound Sn(OAr) 2 (Ar = aryl).
Tin(II) chloride also behaves as a Lewis acid, forming complexes with ligands such as chloride ion, for example:
SnCl 2 (aq) + CsCl(aq) → CsSnCl 3 (aq)
Most of these complexes are pyramidal, and since complexes such as SnCl 3 have a full octet, there is little tendency to add more than one ligand. The lone pair of electrons in such complexes is available for bonding, however, and therefore the complex itself can act as a Lewis base or ligand. This seen in the ferrocene-related product of the following reaction :
SnCl 2 + Fe(η 5 -C 5 H 5 )(CO) 2 HgCl → Fe(η 5 -C 5 H 5 )(CO) 2 SnCl 3 + Hg
SnCl 2 can be used to make a variety of such compounds containing metal-metal bonds, for example:
SnCl 2 + Co 2 (CO) 8 → (CO) 4 Co-(SnCl 2 )-Co(CO) 4
## Preparation
Anhydrous SnCl 2 is prepared by the action of dry hydrogen chloride gas on tin metal. The dihydrate is made by a similar reaction, using hydrochloric acid :
Sn ( s) + 2 HCl ( aq) → SnCl 2 (aq) + H 2 ( g )
The water is then carefully evaporated from the acidic solution to produce crystals of SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O. This dihydrate can be dehydrated to anhydrous using acetic anhydride.
## Uses
A solution of tin(II) chloride containing a little hydrochloric acid is used for the tin-plating of steel, in order to make tin cans. An electric potential is applied, and tin metal is formed at the cathode via electrolysis.
It is used as a catalyst in the production of the plastic polylactic acid (PLA).
Tin(II) chloride also finds wide use as a reducing agent. This is seen in its use for silvering mirrors, where silver metal is deposited on the glass:
Sn 2+ (aq) + 2 Ag + → Sn 4+ (aq) + 2 Ag (s)
A related reduction was traditionally used as an analytical test for Hg 2+ (aq). For example, if SnCl 2 is added dropwise into a solution of mercury(II) chloride, a white precipitate of mercury(I) chloride is first formed; as more SnCl 2 is added this turns black as metallic mercury is formed. Stannous chloride can be used to test for the presence of gold compounds. SnCl 2 turns bright purple in the presence of gold.
This very reaction between stannous chloride and gold was used in episode #215: Clueless of House, M.D. to affirm gold poisoning.
In organic chemistry, SnCl 2 is mainly used in the Stephen reduction, whereby a nitrile is reduced (via an imidoyl chloride salt) to an imine which is easily hydrolysed to an aldehyde. The reaction usually works best with aromatic nitriles Aryl-CN. A related reaction (called the Sonn-Müller method) starts with an amide, which is treated with PCl 5 to form the imidoyl chloride salt.
The Stephen reduction is less used today, because it has been mostly superseded by diisobutylaluminium hydride reduction.
Additionally, SnCl 2 is used to selectively reduce aromatic nitro groups to anilines.
SnCl 2 also reduces quinones to hydroquinones.
Stannous chloride is also added as a food additive with E number E512 to some canned and bottled foods, where it serves as a colour-retention agent and antioxidant.

How to make Tin(II)-iodide:
1.) Sn + 2HCl + CuSO4 --> SnCl2 + CuSO3 + H2 (This step takes about 2H)
2.) Zn + I2 + H2O --> ZnI2 (Icebath)
3.) SnCl2 + ZnI2 --> SnI2 + ZnCl2
Tin(II)-iodide is an neon-Orange powder and Toxic!
