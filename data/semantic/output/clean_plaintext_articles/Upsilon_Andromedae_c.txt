Upsilon Andromedae c is an extrasolar planet orbiting the Sun -like star Upsilon Andromedae A every 241.5 days . Its discovery in 1999 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler made Upsilon Andromedae the first known star (excluding the pulsar PSR 1257+12) to host a multiple-planet planetary system. Upsilon Andromedae c is the second known planet in order of distance from its star.
## Discovery
Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, Upsilon Andromedae c was detected by measuring variations in its star's radial velocity as a result of the planet's gravity . This was done by making precise measurements of the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Upsilon Andromedae A. At the time of discovery, Upsilon Andromedae A was already known to host one extrasolar planet, the hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b , however by 1999 it was clear that the inner planet could not explain the velocity curve.
In 1999, astronomers at both San Francisco State University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics independently concluded that a three-planet model best fit the data. The two new planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae c and Upsilon Andromedae d .
## Orbit and mass
Like the majority of long- period extrasolar planets, the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c is eccentric, more so than any of the major planets in our solar system (including Pluto ). If placed in our solar system, Upsilon Andromedae c would lie between the orbits of Earth and Venus .
The high orbital eccentricity may be the result of gravitational perturbations from the planet Upsilon Andromedae d. It is thought that interactions between Upsilon Andromedae d and a (now lost) outer planet moved Upsilon Andromedae d into an orbit closer to the star, where it gradually caused the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c to become eccentric. Simulations suggest that the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c returns to its original circular state roughly once every 6,700 years.
A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. For Upsilon Andromedae c, this lower limit is 1.97 times the mass of Jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the planet's orbit, the true mass may be much greater.
## Characteristics
Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae c is a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet has only been detected indirectly through observations of its star, properties such as its radius, composition and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that the upper atmosphere of Upsilon Andromedae c is cloudless .
