William ("Willie") Charles Renshaw (born January 3, 1861 in Leamington, Warwickshire â€“ died August 12, 1904 in Swanage, Dorset ) was one of the greatest British male tennis players of all time.
He won fourteen Wimbledon titles: seven in singles (an all-time record he now shares with Pete Sampras ) and seven in doubles, partnering with his twin brother Ernest Renshaw. In 1983, Renshaw was elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.
