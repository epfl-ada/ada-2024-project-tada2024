As a means of recording the passage of time , the 18th century refers to the century that lasted from 1701 through 1800 in the Gregorian calendar.
Some history scholars will sometimes specifically refer to the 18th century as 1715- 1789, denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution , or even 1688-1789, denoting the period of time between the Glorious Revolution in England and the start of the French Revolution. British historians such as Frank O'Gorman sometimes refer to the "Long Eighteenth Century" running from the Revolution of 1688 to the Great Reform Act of 1832.
