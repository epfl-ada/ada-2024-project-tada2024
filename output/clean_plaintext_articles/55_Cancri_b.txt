55 Cancri b (occasionally referred to as 55 Cancri Ab in order to distinguish it from the star 55 Cancri B) is an extrasolar planet orbiting the Sun-like star 55 Cancri A every 14.7 days. It is the second planet in order of distance from its star, and is an example of a  hot Jupiter. Discovered in  1996 by  Geoffrey Marcy and  R. Paul Butler, 55 Cancri b was the fourth known extrasolar planet, excluding  pulsar planets.
 Discovery
Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, 55 Cancri b was discovered by detecting variations in its star's  radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. By making sensitive measurements of the  Doppler shift of the  spectrum of 55 Cancri A, a 15-day periodicity was detected. The planet was announced in 1996, together with the planet of  Tau Boötis and the innermost planet of Upsilon Andromedae.Even when this inner planet, with a  mass at least 78% times that of Jupiter was accounted for, the star still showed a drift in its radial velocity. This eventually led to the discovery of the outer planet 55 Cancri d in  2002. Orbit and mass
55 Cancri b is in a short-period orbit, though not so extreme as that of the previously-detected hot Jupiter  51 Pegasi b. The planet is in a 1:3  orbital resonance with the nearby planet 55 Cancri c.A limitation of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be determined.  Astrometric measurements made with the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the outer planet is  inclined at around 53° with respect to the plane of the sky. Assuming this measurement is correct and the planetary system is  coplanar, the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 1 Jupiter mass. Characteristics
Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that 55 Cancri b is a gas giant with no  solid surface. Since the planet has only been detected indirectly, properties such as its  radius, composition and  temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and that its environment is close to  chemical equilibrium, 55 Cancri b is predicted to have a cloudless upper  atmosphere with a  spectrum dominated by  alkali metal  absorption.The planet is unlikely to have large  moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales relative to the age of the system.
