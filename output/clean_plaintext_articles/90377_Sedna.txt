90377 Sedna is a  trans-Neptunian object, discovered by  Michael Brown ( Caltech),  Chad Trujillo ( Gemini Observatory) and  David Rabinowitz ( Yale University) on  November 14,  2003. At the time of its discovery it was the most distant observed natural solar system body. Sedna may qualify as a  dwarf planet pending the detailed definition of that category by the  International Astronomical Union.
 General information
Sedna was discovered during a survey conducted with the  Samuel Oschin telescope at  Palomar Observatory near  San Diego, California (USA) using Yale's 160 megapixel Palomar Quest camera and was observed within days on telescopes from Chile, Spain, and the USA ( Arizona, and  Hawaii).  NASA's orbiting  Spitzer Space Telescope was also pointed toward the object, but could not detect it — putting an upper-bound on its  diameter at roughly three-quarters that of Pluto.The object is named after  Sedna, the  Inuit goddess of the sea, who was believed to live in the cold depths of the Arctic Ocean. Before Sedna was officially named it had  provisional designation 2003 VB12. Orbital characteristics

Sedna has a highly  elliptical  orbit, with its  aphelion estimated at 975  AU and its  perihelion at about 76.16 AU. At its discovery it was approaching perihelion at about 90 AU from the Sun. It was the farthest from the Sun that any solar system object had up to then been observed, although some objects like long-period comets originally observed at closer distances were most likely further from the Sun than Sedna but too dim to be observed.  Eris was later detected at 97 AU.Sedna's orbit takes about 12000  years. It will reach  perihelion in 2075 or 2076.When first discovered, Sedna was believed to have an unusually long rotational period (20 to 50 days). A search was thus made for a  natural satellite, the most likely cause for such a long rotation, but investigation by the Hubble Space Telescope in March 2004 observed no such object orbiting the planetoid. New measurements from the  MMT telescope suggest a much shorter rotation period, only about 10 hours, rather typical for bodies of its size.A study done by  Hal Levison and  Alessandro Morbidelli of the  Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur (OCA) in  Nice, France, suggested that the most likely explanation for Sedna's orbit was that it had been perturbed by a close (~800 AU) pass by another star in the first 100 million years or so of the solar system's existence, possibly one of the other stars that formed out of the same collapsing nebula as the Sun. They proposed another, less probable scenario that managed to explain Sedna's orbit very well —Sedna could have formed around a  brown dwarf about 20 times less massive than the Sun and have been captured by the solar system when the brown dwarf passed through it.Another possible explanation, advanced by Gomez, involves a hypothetical distant ‘planet’ (a planetary-sized companion in the inner  Oort cloud). Recent simulation show that Sedna's orbit characteristics could be explained by perturbations by a Neptune-mass object at 2000 AU (or less), a Jupiter-mass at 5000AU or even an Earth-mass object at 1000AU.Another object,  2000 CR105, has an orbit similar to Sedna's but a bit less extreme: perihelion is 44.3 AU, aphelion is 394 AU, and the orbital period is 3240 years. Its orbit may have resulted from the same processes that produced Sedna's orbit. Physical characteristics


 Sedna compared to  Eris, Pluto,  2005 FY9,  2003 EL61,  Orcus,  Quaoar,  Varuna, and Earth.


Sedna has an estimated diameter of between  1180 and 1800 kilometres (730 to 1120 miles). At the time of its discovery it was the largest object found in the solar system since Pluto was discovered in 1930. It is now generally believed to be the 5th largest known  trans-Neptunian object after  Eris, Pluto,  2003 EL61, and  2005 FY9. The planetoid is so far from the Sun that the temperature never rises above 33  kelvins (−240  °C; −400  °F).Observations from Chile show that Sedna is one of the reddest objects in the solar system, nearly as red as  Mars. Unlike Pluto and Charon, Sedna appears to have very little methane ice or water ice on its surface; Chad Trujillo and his colleagues at the Gemini Observatory in  Hawaii suggest that Sedna's dark red colour is caused by a  hydrocarbon sludge, or  tholin, like that found on  5145 Pholus. Its surface is homogeneous in colour and spectrum; this is probably because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches like that on  8405 Asbolus.Sedna's and  Triton's spectra have been recently compared suggesting the following common model of the surface: 24% Triton  tholin, 7%  amorphous carbon, 26%  methanol ice with 33%  methane. Classification
The discoverers have argued that Sedna is actually the first observed body belonging to the  Oort cloud, saying that it is too far out to be considered a Kuiper belt object. Because it is a great deal closer to the Sun than was expected for an Oort cloud object, and has an  inclination roughly in line with the planets and the Kuiper belt, they described the  planetoid as being an inner Oort cloud object, situated in the disc reaching from the Kuiper belt to the spherical part of the cloud.A number of explanations have been put forward since, including a passing star and a distant, planet-sized object.Sedna, together with a few other objects discovered since (e.g.  2000 CR105), prompted suggestions of a new category of distant objects named Extended scattered disc (E-SDO), detached objects, Distant Detached Objects (DDO) or Scattered-Extended in the formal classification by  Deep Ecliptic Survey.The last classification, introduces a formal distinction between Scattered-Near objects (which could be scattered by Neptune) e.g.  Eris from Scattered-Extended objects like Sedna. The distinction is made formally, using the orbital elements (see  Tisserand's parameter).The discovery of Sedna had also resurrected the question of which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On  March 15,  2004, articles in the popular press reported that "the  tenth planet has been discovered". This question was answered under the new  International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on  August 24,  2006. Sedna may be made a candidate for consideration as a  dwarf planet. It is not, however, considered to be a planet.

New measurements from the  MMT telescope suggest a much shorter rotation period, only about 10 hours, rather typical for bodies of its size.A study done by  Hal Levison and  Alessandro Morbidelli of the  Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur (OCA) in  Nice, France, suggested that the most likely explanation for Sedna's orbit was that it had been perturbed by a close (~800 AU) pass by another star in the first 100 million years or so of the solar system's existence, possibly one of the other stars that formed out of the same collapsing nebula as the Sun. They proposed another, less probable scenario that managed to explain Sedna's orbit very well —Sedna could have formed around a  brown dwarf about 20 times less massive than the Sun and have been captured by the solar system when the brown dwarf passed through it.Another possible explanation, advanced by Gomez, involves a hypothetical distant ‘planet’ (a planetary-sized companion in the inner  Oort cloud). Recent simulation show that Sedna's orbit characteristics could be explained by perturbations by a Neptune-mass object at 2000 AU (or less), a Jupiter-mass at 5000AU or even an Earth-mass object at 1000AU.Another object,  2000 CR105, has an orbit similar to Sedna's but a bit less extreme: perihelion is 44.3 AU, aphelion is 394 AU, and the orbital period is 3240 years. Its orbit may have resulted from the same processes that produced Sedna's orbit. Physical characteristics


 Sedna compared to  Eris, Pluto,  2005 FY9,  2003 EL61,  Orcus,  Quaoar,  Varuna, and Earth.


Sedna has an estimated diameter of between  1180 and 1800 kilometres (730 to 1120 miles). At the time of its discovery it was the largest object found in the solar system since Pluto was discovered in 1930. It is now generally believed to be the 5th largest known  trans-Neptunian object after  Eris, Pluto,  2003 EL61, and  2005 FY9. The planetoid is so far from the Sun that the temperature never rises above 33  kelvins (−240  °C; −400  °F).Observations from Chile show that Sedna is one of the reddest objects in the solar system, nearly as red as  Mars. Unlike Pluto and Charon, Sedna appears to have very little methane ice or water ice on its surface; Chad Trujillo and his colleagues at the Gemini Observatory in  Hawaii suggest that Sedna's dark red colour is caused by a  hydrocarbon sludge, or  tholin, like that found on  5145 Pholus. Its surface is homogeneous in colour and spectrum; this is probably because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches like that on  8405 Asbolus.Sedna's and  Triton's spectra have been recently compared suggesting the following common model of the surface: 24% Triton  tholin, 7%  amorphous carbon, 26%  methanol ice with 33%  methane. Classification
The discoverers have argued that Sedna is actually the first observed body belonging to the  Oort cloud, saying that it is too far out to be considered a Kuiper belt object. Because it is a great deal closer to the Sun than was expected for an Oort cloud object, and has an  inclination roughly in line with the planets and the Kuiper belt, they described the  planetoid as being an inner Oort cloud object, situated in the disc reaching from the Kuiper belt to the spherical part of the cloud.A number of explanations have been put forward since, including a passing star and a distant, planet-sized object.Sedna, together with a few other objects discovered since (e.g.  2000 CR105), prompted suggestions of a new category of distant objects named Extended scattered disc (E-SDO), detached objects, Distant Detached Objects (DDO) or Scattered-Extended in the formal classification by  Deep Ecliptic Survey.The last classification, introduces a formal distinction between Scattered-Near objects (which could be scattered by Neptune) e.g.  Eris from Scattered-Extended objects like Sedna. The distinction is made formally, using the orbital elements (see  Tisserand's parameter).The discovery of Sedna had also resurrected the question of which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On  March 15,  2004, articles in the popular press reported that "the  tenth planet has been discovered". This question was answered under the new  International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on  August 24,  2006. Sedna may be made a candidate for consideration as a  dwarf planet. It is not, however, considered to be a planet.

Because it is a great deal closer to the Sun than was expected for an Oort cloud object, and has an  inclination roughly in line with the planets and the Kuiper belt, they described the  planetoid as being an inner Oort cloud object, situated in the disc reaching from the Kuiper belt to the spherical part of the cloud.A number of explanations have been put forward since, including a passing star and a distant, planet-sized object.Sedna, together with a few other objects discovered since (e.g.  2000 CR105), prompted suggestions of a new category of distant objects named Extended scattered disc (E-SDO), detached objects, Distant Detached Objects (DDO) or Scattered-Extended in the formal classification by  Deep Ecliptic Survey.The last classification, introduces a formal distinction between Scattered-Near objects (which could be scattered by Neptune) e.g.  Eris from Scattered-Extended objects like Sedna. The distinction is made formally, using the orbital elements (see  Tisserand's parameter).The discovery of Sedna had also resurrected the question of which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On  March 15,  2004, articles in the popular press reported that "the  tenth planet has been discovered". This question was answered under the new  International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on  August 24,  2006. Sedna may be made a candidate for consideration as a  dwarf planet. It is not, however, considered to be a planet.

Observations from Chile show that Sedna is one of the reddest objects in the solar system, nearly as red as  Mars. Unlike Pluto and Charon, Sedna appears to have very little methane ice or water ice on its surface; Chad Trujillo and his colleagues at the Gemini Observatory in  Hawaii suggest that Sedna's dark red colour is caused by a  hydrocarbon sludge, or  tholin, like that found on  5145 Pholus. Its surface is homogeneous in colour and spectrum; this is probably because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches like that on  8405 Asbolus.Sedna's and  Triton's spectra have been recently compared suggesting the following common model of the surface: 24% Triton  tholin, 7%  amorphous carbon, 26%  methanol ice with 33%  methane.
