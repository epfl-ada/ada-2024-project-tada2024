Almaty (Алматы; formerly known as Alma-Ata, also Vernyj, Vyernyi (Верный) in  Imperial Russia) is the largest city in Kazakhstan, with a population of 1,185,900 ( 2004) (8% of the population of Kazakhstan) citizens.The name "Almaty" means "appled" (the place with apples), the older version of its name, Alma-Ata, literally means "father-apple". In the surrounding region, unrivalled  genetic diversity among the  alma, the wild apples, implies that south-east Kazakhstan is where the domesticated apple is native.A troop of  Siberian  Cossacks from  Omsk founded the fort Zailiysky in  1854 at the foot of the  Tian Shan mountain range, and renamed it one year later to Vernyj, a name that remained until 1921. In 1921, the name Alma-Ata ("father-apple") was created by the  Bolsheviks. In a devastating earthquake in  1911, almost the only large building that remained standing was the Russian Orthodox cathedral. In the 1920s, after the completion of the  Turkestan-Siberia Railway, Alma-Ata, as it was then known, became a major stopping point along the track. In  1929, Almaty became the capital of the  Kazakh SSR.In late  1991, Almaty became the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan, a designation it kept until  1998, when the capital was moved to  Astana. Almaty, however, remains the largest city in Kazakhstan and the country's major commercial centre. In  2005, the city launched an Olympic application to host the XXII  Olympic Winter Games in the year  2014, which failed, as the  IOC did not select the city as a candidate. The world's largest apple is also located in Almaty.A short bus ride into the  Tian Shan Mountains brings one to  Medeo, a popular tourist destination, with several hotels and an Olympic-size skating rink.On  21 December  1991, the Charter that ended the Soviet Union creating the  Commonwealth of Independent States was signed there.
