Aluminium chloride (AlCl3) is a  compound of aluminium and chlorine. The solid has a low melting and boiling point, and is  covalently bonded. It  sublimes at 178 ° C. Molten AlCl3  conducts electricity poorly, unlike more  ionic  halides such as  sodium chloride. It exists in the solid state as a six-coordinate layer lattice.AlCl3 adopts the "YCl3" structure, featuring Al3+ cubic close packed layered structure. In contrast, AlBr3 has a more molecular structure, with the Al3+ centers occupying adjacent tetrahedral holes of the close-packed framework of Br− ions. Upon melting AlCl3 gives the  dimer Al2Cl6, which can  vaporise. At higher  temperatures this Al2Cl6 dimer  dissociates into trigonal planar AlCl3, which is structurally analogous to  BF3.
Aluminium chloride is highly  deliquescent, and it can explode in contact with  water because of the high heat of  hydration. It partially  hydrolyses with  H2O, forming some  hydrogen chloride and/or hydrochloric acid.  Aqueous  solutions of AlCl3 are fully ionized, and thus  conduct electricity well. Such solutions are found to be  acidic, indicating that partial  hydrolysis of the Al3+ ion is occurring. This can be described (simplified) as:AlCl3 is probably the most commonly used non-Bronsted  Lewis acid and also one of the most powerful. It finds widespread application in the  chemical industry as a  catalyst for  Friedel-Crafts reactions, both acylations and alkylations. It also finds use in  polymerization and  isomerization reactions of  hydrocarbons. Aluminium chloride, like similar compounds such as  Aluminium chlorohydrate, is also commonly used as an  antiperspirant.Aluminium also forms a lower  chloride, aluminium(I) chloride (AlCl), but this is very unstable and only known in the vapour phase.
 Chemical Properties
Aluminium chloride is a powerful  Lewis acid, capable of forming stable Lewis acid-base adducts with even weak  Lewis bases such as  benzophenone or  mesitylene. Not surprisingly it forms AlCl4− in the presence of  chloride ion.In water, partial hydrolysis forms  HCl gas or H3O+, as described in the overview above.  Aqueous solutions behave similarly to other aluminium salts containing hydrated Al3+  ions - for example giving a gelatinous  precipitate of  aluminium hydroxide upon reaction with the correct quantity of aqueous sodium hydroxide:AlCl3( aq) + 3NaOH( aq) →  Al(OH)3( s) + 3 NaCl( aq) Preparation
Aluminium chloride is manufactured by the  exothermic reaction of the elements, aluminium and chlorine. It is commercially available in large quantities. Uses
The  Friedel-Crafts reaction is the major use for aluminium chloride, for example in the preparation of  anthraquinone (for the  dyestuffs industry) from benzene and  phosgene. In the general  Friedel-Crafts reaction an  acyl chloride or  alkyl halide reacts with an  aromatic system as shown:With benzene  derivatives, the major product is the  para  isomer. The alkylation reaction has many associated problems, such as in  Friedel-Crafts, so it is less widely used than the acylation reaction. For both reactions the aluminium chloride (and other materials and the equipment) must be moderately dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel-Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride " catalyst" needs to be present in full  stoichiometric quantities in order for the reaction to go to completion, because it  complexes strongly with the products (see chemical properties above). This makes it very difficult to recycle, so it must be destroyed after use, generating a large amount of corrosive waste. For this reason chemists are examining the use of more  environmentally benign catalysts such as ytterbium(III)  triflate or dysprosium(III) triflate, which can be recycled.Aluminium chloride can also be used to introduce  aldehyde groups onto  aromatic rings, for example via the  Gatterman-Koch reaction which uses  carbon monoxide,  hydrogen chloride and a copper(I) chloride co- catalyst):Aluminium chloride finds a wide variety of other applications in  organic chemistry. For example, it can catalyse the " ene reaction", such as the addition of  3-buten-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone) to  carvone:AlCl3 is also widely used for  polymerization and  isomerization reactions of  hydrocarbons. Important examples include the manufacture of  ethylbenzene, which used to make  styrene and thus  polystyrene, and also production of  dodecylbenzene, which is used for making  detergents.Aluminum chloride combined with aluminium in the presence of an arene can be used to synthesize bis(arene) metal complexes, e.g.  bis(benzene)chromium, from certain metal halides via the so-called  Fischer-Hafner synthesis. Precautions
Avoid bringing anhydrous AlCl3 in contact with  water or  bases, or an explosive reaction may result. Gloves and  safety goggles should be worn, along with a  face shield for larger amounts. The material should be handled in a  fume cupboard or  chemical hood. When handled in moist air, AlCl3 rapidly absorbs moisture to become a highly  acidic and sticky "goo", and it rapidly attacks many materials such as  stainless steel and  rubber.

This makes it very difficult to recycle, so it must be destroyed after use, generating a large amount of corrosive waste. For this reason chemists are examining the use of more  environmentally benign catalysts such as ytterbium(III)  triflate or dysprosium(III) triflate, which can be recycled.Aluminium chloride can also be used to introduce  aldehyde groups onto  aromatic rings, for example via the  Gatterman-Koch reaction which uses  carbon monoxide,  hydrogen chloride and a copper(I) chloride co- catalyst):Aluminium chloride finds a wide variety of other applications in  organic chemistry. For example, it can catalyse the " ene reaction", such as the addition of  3-buten-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone) to  carvone:AlCl3 is also widely used for  polymerization and  isomerization reactions of  hydrocarbons. Important examples include the manufacture of  ethylbenzene, which used to make  styrene and thus  polystyrene, and also production of  dodecylbenzene, which is used for making  detergents.Aluminum chloride combined with aluminium in the presence of an arene can be used to synthesize bis(arene) metal complexes, e.g.  bis(benzene)chromium, from certain metal halides via the so-called  Fischer-Hafner synthesis. Precautions
Avoid bringing anhydrous AlCl3 in contact with  water or  bases, or an explosive reaction may result. Gloves and  safety goggles should be worn, along with a  face shield for larger amounts. The material should be handled in a  fume cupboard or  chemical hood. When handled in moist air, AlCl3 rapidly absorbs moisture to become a highly  acidic and sticky "goo", and it rapidly attacks many materials such as  stainless steel and  rubber.

AlCl3( aq) + 3NaOH( aq) →  Al(OH)3( s) + 3 NaCl( aq) Preparation
Aluminium chloride is manufactured by the  exothermic reaction of the elements, aluminium and chlorine. It is commercially available in large quantities. Uses
The  Friedel-Crafts reaction is the major use for aluminium chloride, for example in the preparation of  anthraquinone (for the  dyestuffs industry) from benzene and  phosgene. In the general  Friedel-Crafts reaction an  acyl chloride or  alkyl halide reacts with an  aromatic system as shown:With benzene  derivatives, the major product is the  para  isomer. The alkylation reaction has many associated problems, such as in  Friedel-Crafts, so it is less widely used than the acylation reaction. For both reactions the aluminium chloride (and other materials and the equipment) must be moderately dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel-Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride " catalyst" needs to be present in full  stoichiometric quantities in order for the reaction to go to completion, because it  complexes strongly with the products (see chemical properties above). This makes it very difficult to recycle, so it must be destroyed after use, generating a large amount of corrosive waste.
