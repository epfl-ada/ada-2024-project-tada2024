Americium ( IPA: /ˌaməˈrɪsiəm/) is a  synthetic element in the periodic table that has the symbol Am and  atomic number 95. A  radioactive metallic element, americium is an  actinide that was obtained by bombarding plutonium with neutrons and was the fourth  transuranic element to be discovered. It was named for the  Americas, by analogy with europium.
 Notable characteristics
Freshly prepared poop poop has a white and silvery  lustre, at  room temperatures it slowly tarnishes in dry air. It is more silvery than plutonium or neptunium and apparently more malleable than neptunium or uranium.  Alpha emission from 241Am is approximately three times that of radium.  Gram quantities of 241Am emit intense  gamma rays which creates a serious exposure problem for anyone handling the element.Americium is also  fissile; the critical mass for an unreflected sphere of 241Am is approximately 60 kilograms. It is unlikely that Americium would be used as a weapons material, as its minimum critical mass is considerably larger than more readily obtained Plutonium or Uranium isotopes.   in the environment for details of the environmental aspects of this element. Applications
This element can be produced in  kilogram amounts and has some uses (mostly 241Am since it is easier to produce relatively pure samples of this isotope). Americium has found its way into the household, where one type of  smoke detector contains a tiny amount (about 0.2  microgram) of 241Am as a source of  ionizing radiation. 241Am has been used as a portable gamma ray source for use in  radiography. The element has also been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. 242Am is a neutron emitter and has found uses in  neutron radiography. However this isotope is extremely expensive to produce in usable quantities. History
Americium was  first synthesized by  Glenn T. Seaborg, Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and  Albert Ghiorso in late  1944 at the wartime Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago (now known as  Argonne National Laboratory). The team created the  isotope 241Am by subjecting 239Pu to successive  neutron capture reactions in a  nuclear reactor. This created 240Pu and then 241Pu which in turn decayed into 241Am via  beta decay. Seaborg was granted  patent 3,156,523 for "Element 95 and Method of Producing Said Element". The discovery of americium and curium was first announced informally on a children's quiz show in 1945.   Isotopes


 Sample of Americium


18  radioisotopes of americium have been characterized, with the most stable being 243Am with a  half-life of 7370 years, and 241Am with a half-life of 432.2 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 51 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 100 minutes. This element also has 8  meta states, with the most stable being 242mAm (t½ 141 years). The isotopes of americium range in  atomic weight from 231.046  amu (231Am) to 249.078 amu (249Am).  Chemistry
In aqueous systems the most common oxidation state is +3, it is very much harder to oxidise Am(III) to Am(IV) than it is to do the same oxidation for Pu(III).Currently the  solvent extraction chemistry of americium is important as in several areas of the world  scientists are working on reducing the medium term  radiotoxicity of the waste from the reprocessing of used  nuclear fuel.See  liquid-liquid extraction for some examples of the solvent extraction of americium.Americium unlike uranium does not readily form a dioxide americyl core (AmO2) , this is because americium is very hard to oxidise above the +3 oxidation state when it is in an aqeuous solution. In the environment, this americyl core could complex with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties (OH-, NO2-, NO3-, and SO4-2) to form charged complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.

This element also has 8  meta states, with the most stable being 242mAm (t½ 141 years). The isotopes of americium range in  atomic weight from 231.046  amu (231Am) to 249.078 amu (249Am).  Chemistry
In aqueous systems the most common oxidation state is +3, it is very much harder to oxidise Am(III) to Am(IV) than it is to do the same oxidation for Pu(III).Currently the  solvent extraction chemistry of americium is important as in several areas of the world  scientists are working on reducing the medium term  radiotoxicity of the waste from the reprocessing of used  nuclear fuel.See  liquid-liquid extraction for some examples of the solvent extraction of americium.Americium unlike uranium does not readily form a dioxide americyl core (AmO2) , this is because americium is very hard to oxidise above the +3 oxidation state when it is in an aqeuous solution. In the environment, this americyl core could complex with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties (OH-, NO2-, NO3-, and SO4-2) to form charged complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.
