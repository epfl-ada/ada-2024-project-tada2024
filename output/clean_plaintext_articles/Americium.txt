Americium ( IPA: /ˌaməˈrɪsiəm/ ) is a synthetic element in the periodic table that has the symbol Am and atomic number 95. A radioactive metallic element, americium is an actinide that was obtained by bombarding plutonium with neutrons and was the fourth transuranic element to be discovered. It was named for the Americas, by analogy with europium .
## Notable characteristics
Freshly prepared poop poop has a white and silvery lustre, at room temperatures it slowly tarnishes in dry air. It is more silvery than plutonium or neptunium and apparently more malleable than neptunium or uranium . Alpha emission from 241 Am is approximately three times that of radium . Gram quantities of 241 Am emit intense gamma rays which creates a serious exposure problem for anyone handling the element.
Americium is also fissile; the critical mass for an unreflected sphere of 241 Am is approximately 60 kilograms. It is unlikely that Americium would be used as a weapons material, as its minimum critical mass is considerably larger than more readily obtained Plutonium or Uranium isotopes.

## Applications
This element can be produced in kilogram amounts and has some uses (mostly 241 Am since it is easier to produce relatively pure samples of this isotope). Americium has found its way into the household, where one type of smoke detector contains a tiny amount (about 0.2 microgram) of 241 Am as a source of ionizing radiation. 241 Am has been used as a portable gamma ray source for use in radiography. The element has also been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. 242 Am is a neutron emitter and has found uses in neutron radiography. However this isotope is extremely expensive to produce in usable quantities.
## History
Americium was first synthesized by Glenn T. Seaborg, Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso in late 1944 at the wartime Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago (now known as Argonne National Laboratory). The team created the isotope 241 Am by subjecting 239 Pu to successive neutron capture reactions in a nuclear reactor. This created 240 Pu and then 241 Pu which in turn decayed into 241 Am via beta decay. Seaborg was granted patent 3,156,523 for "Element 95 and Method of Producing Said Element". The discovery of americium and curium was first announced informally on a children's quiz show in 1945.
## Isotopes
18 radioisotopes of americium have been characterized, with the most stable being 243 Am with a half-life of 7370 years, and 241 Am with a half-life of 432.2 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 51 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 100 minutes. This element also has 8 meta states, with the most stable being 242m Am (t ½ 141 years). The isotopes of americium range in atomic weight from 231.046 amu ( 231 Am) to 249.078 amu ( 249 Am).
## Chemistry
In aqueous systems the most common oxidation state is +3, it is very much harder to oxidise Am(III) to Am(IV) than it is to do the same oxidation for Pu(III).
Currently the solvent extraction chemistry of americium is important as in several areas of the world scientists are working on reducing the medium term radiotoxicity of the waste from the reprocessing of used nuclear fuel.
See liquid-liquid extraction for some examples of the solvent extraction of americium.
Americium unlike uranium does not readily form a dioxide americyl core (AmO 2 ) , this is because americium is very hard to oxidise above the +3 oxidation state when it is in an aqeuous solution. In the environment, this americyl core could complex with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties (OH - , NO 2 - , NO 3 - , and SO 4 -2 ) to form charged complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.
