 Cultivation and uses


 Wild Angelica (Angelica sylvestris) from Thomé, Flora von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz 1885


Some members are grown as a  flavoring agent and for their  medicinal properties. The most notable of these is  Garden Angelica (A. archangelica) which is commonly known just as Angelica. Natives of Lapland use the fleshy roots as food and the stalks as medicine. Crystallized strips of young angelica stems and midribs are green in colour and are sold as decorative and flavoursome cake decoration material. The roots and seeds are sometimes employed to flavor  gin and  Chartreuse. Seacoast Angelica (A. lucida) has been eaten as a sort of "wild celery".A. sylvestris and some other species are eaten by the  larvae of some  Lepidoptera species including  Bordered Pug,  Grey Pug,  Lime-speck Pug and  The V-Pug.A. dawsonii was used by several first nations in North America for ritual purposesA. atropurpurea is found in North America from  Newfoundland west to  Wisconsin and south to  Maryland and was smoked by Missouri tribes for colds and respiratory ailments. This species is very similar in appearance to the poisonous  water hemlock Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica"
