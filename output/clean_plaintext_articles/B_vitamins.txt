Vitamin B is a complex of eight water soluble vitamins, active in cell  metabolism. The name arises because it was once considered a single vitamin, much like Vitamin C or Vitamin D. Since later research has shown it is in fact a complex of  chemically distinct vitamins that happen to often coexist in the same foods, the name has gradually declined in use, being replaced by the generic term "the B vitamins", the vitamin B complex, or by the specific names of each vitamin.

 B vitamins deficiency
Several named vitamin deficiency diseases may result from the lack of sufficient B-vitamins.
Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) deficiency causes Beriberi. Symptoms of this disease of the  nervous system include weight loss, emotional disturbances,  Wernicke's encephalopathy (impaired sensory perception), weakness and pain in the limbs, periods of  irregular heartbeat, and edema (swelling of bodily tissues).  Heart failure and  death may occur in advanced cases. Chronic thiamine deficiency can also cause  Korsakoff's syndrome, an irreversible psychosis characterized by  amnesia and  confabulation.Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) deficiency causes  Ariboflavinosis. Symptoms may include cheilosis (cracks in the lips), high sensitivity to sunlight,  angular cheilitis,  glossitis (inflammation of the tongue),  seborrheic dermatitis or pseudo- syphilis (particularly affecting the  scrotum or  labia majora and the  mouth),  pharyngitis,  hyperemia, and edema of the  pharyngeal and  oral  mucosa.Vitamin B3 (Niacin) deficiency, along with a deficiency of  tryptophan causes Pellagra. Symptoms include aggression,  dermatitis,  insomnia,  weakness, mental confusion, and  diarrhea. In advanced cases, pellagra may lead to  dementia and death.
Deficiencies of other B vitamins result in symptoms that are not part of a named deficiency disease.
Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid) deficiency can result in acne and  Paresthesia, although it is uncommon.Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) deficiency may lead to anaemia,  depression, dermatitis, high blood pressure ( hypertension) and elevated levels of  homocysteine.Vitamin B7 deficiency does not typically cause symptoms in adults but may lead to impaired growth and neurological disorders in infants.Vitamin B9 (Folic acid) deficiency results in elevated levels of  homocysteine. Deficiency in pregnant women can lead to birth defects.Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) deficiency causes pernicious anaemia, memory loss and other cognitive decline. It is most likely to occur among elderly people as absorption through the gut declines with age. In extreme (fortunately rare) cases paralysis can result.
 Related nutrients
Other substances which are very similar in structure and function to the B vitamins have been discovered. Many of them are "essential" vitamins to various plants and animals which cannot synthesize their own. (The adjective "essential" in the context of medicine and nutrition refers to a nutrient being required because it cannot be made by the body. Non-"essential" nutrients are still important.) None of these are "essential" vitamins to humans, because humans can synthesize their own, though some only technically so (choline, for instance, can be metabolized in humans by cannibalizing cells to make use of the choline they contain, killing the cells in the process).Many of the following substances have been referred to as vitamins because they were believed to be vitamins at one time. Most of them are vitamins with respect to certain plants and animals as well. While they are non-"essential" in that they may be synthesized by the body from other starting materials, they are still important. See also  Orthomolecular medicine.

The B vitamins often work together to deliver a number of health benefits to the body. B vitamins have been shown to:
Bolster  metabolismMaintain healthy skin and muscle toneEnhance  immune and  nervous system functionPromote  cell growth and  division — including that of the  red blood cells that help prevent anaemia.
Together, they also help combat the symptoms and causes of  stress,  depression, and  cardiovascular disease.All B vitamins are water soluble, and are dispersed throughout the body.

The B vitamins often work together to deliver a number of health benefits to the body. B vitamins have been shown to:
Bolster  metabolismMaintain healthy skin and muscle toneEnhance  immune and  nervous system functionPromote  cell growth and  division — including that of the  red blood cells that help prevent anaemia.
Together, they also help combat the symptoms and causes of  stress,  depression, and  cardiovascular disease.All B vitamins are water soluble, and are dispersed throughout the body. They must be replenished daily with any excess excreted in the  urine. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"




Other substances which are very similar in structure and function to the B vitamins have been discovered. Many of them are "essential" vitamins to various plants and animals which cannot synthesize their own. (The adjective "essential" in the context of medicine and nutrition refers to a nutrient being required because it cannot be made by the body. Non-"essential" nutrients are still important.) None of these are "essential" vitamins to humans, because humans can synthesize their own, though some only technically so (choline, for instance, can be metabolized in humans by cannibalizing cells to make use of the choline they contain, killing the cells in the process).Many of the following substances have been referred to as vitamins because they were believed to be vitamins at one time. Most of them are vitamins with respect to certain plants and animals as well. While they are non-"essential" in that they may be synthesized by the body from other starting materials, they are still important. See also  Orthomolecular medicine.
Vitamin B4 ( Adenine) –Vitamin B7 "Vitamin I" of Centanni E. (1935) — more commonly called Vitamin B7 and also called 'Enteral factor' is a water and alcohol (ethanol & methanol) soluble Rice bran factor which prevents digestive disterbance in Pigions. It governes the anatomical and functional integrity of the intestineal tract. Later (1945) found in Yeast; Inositol, Nicotinic acid, & Biotin are possibles. Note: Carnitine has also been claimed but is not possible as it is insoluble in alcohol. Carnitine as Vitamin B7 was wrongly coped from Vitamin BT.Vitamin B8 ( Ergadenylic acid) – also known as  adenosine monophosphateVitamin B10 ( para-aminobenzoic acid, or PABA)–  Vitamin B11 ( Pteryl-hepta-glutamic acid) – Chick growth factor, which is a form of Folic acid. Later found to be one of five folates necessary for humans); ( L-carnitine) in France.Vitamin B13 ( Pyrimidinecarboxylic acid) – Also known as Orotic acid, often misspelled erotic acid.Vitamin B14 – cell proliferant, anti-anaemia, rat growth, an antitumor pterin phosphate named by Earl R.
