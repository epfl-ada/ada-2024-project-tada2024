A bandicoot is any of about 20 species of small to medium-sized, terrestrial  marsupial  omnivores in the order  Peramelemorphia. The word bandicoot is an  anglicised form of the  Telugu word pandi-kokku, (loosely, pig- rat) which originally referred to the unrelated Indian  Bandicoot Rat. The other two species of peramelemorphs are the  bilbies.Classification within the Peramelemorphia used to be simple: there were thought to be two families in the order — the short-legged and mostly  herbivorous bandicoots, and the longer-legged, more nearly  carnivorous bilbies. In recent years, however, it has become clear that the situation is more complex. First, the bandicoots of the  New Guinean and far-northern Australian rainforests were deemed distinct from all other bandicoots, and these were grouped together in the separate family  Peroryctidae. More recently, the bandicoot families were reunited in  Peramelidae, with the New Guinean species split into four genera in two subfamilies,  Peroryctinae and  Echymiperinae, while the "true bandicoots" occupy the subfamily  Peramelinae. The only exception is the extinct  Pig-footed Bandicoot, which has been given its own family,  Chaeropodidae.The  embryos of bandicoots, unlike other marsupials, form a  placenta-like organ that connects it to the  uterine wall. The function of this organ is probably to transfer nutrients from the mother; however the structure is small compared to those of the  placentalia.
