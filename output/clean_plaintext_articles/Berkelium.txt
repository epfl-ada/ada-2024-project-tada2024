Berkelium ( IPA: /bəˈkiːliəm/) is a  synthetic element in the periodic table that has the symbol Bk and  atomic number 97. A  radioactive metallic element in the  actinide series, berkelium was first synthesized by bombarding americium with  alpha particles (helium  ions) and was named after  Berkeley, California and the  University of California, Berkeley. Berkelium was the fifth  transuranic element to be synthesized.
 Notable characteristics
Weighable amounts of 249Bk (half-life 314 days) make it possible to determine some of its properties using macroscopic quantities.  As of 2004 it had not been isolated in its elemental form, but it is predicted to be a silvery metal that would easily  oxidize in air at elevated temperatures and would be  soluble in dilute  mineral acids. X-ray diffraction techniques have been used to identify various berkelium  compounds such as berkelium dioxide (BkO2), berkelium fluoride (BkF3), berkelium oxychloride (BkOCl), and berkelium trioxide (BkO3). In  1962 visible amounts of berkelium  chloride were isolated that weighed 3 billionths of a  gram. This was the first time visible amounts of a pure berkelium compound were produced.Like other actinides, berkelium  bio-accumulates in  skeletal tissue. This element has no known uses outside of basic research and plays no biological role. History
Berkelium was  first synthesized by  Glenn T. Seaborg,  Albert Ghiorso, Stanley G. Thompson, and Kenneth Street, Jr at the  University of California, Berkeley in December  1949. The team used a  cyclotron to bombard a  milligram-sized target of 241Am with  alpha particles to produce 243Bk ( half-life 4.5 hours) and two  free neutrons. One of the longest lived  isotopes of the element, 249Bk (half-life 320 days), was later synthesized by subjecting a 244Cm target with an intense beam of neutrons. Isotopes
19  radioisotopes of berkelium have been characterized, with the most stable being 247Bk with a  half-life of 1380 years, 248Bk with a half-life of >9 years, and 249Bk with a half-life of 320 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 5 days, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 5 hours. This element also has 2  meta states, with the most stable being 248mBk (t½ 23.7 hours). The isotopes of berkelium range in  atomic weight from 235.057  amu (235Bk) to 254.091 amu (254Bk).
