Bismuth ( IPA: [ˈbɪzməθ]) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Bi and  atomic number 83. This heavy, brittle, white crystalline trivalent  poor metal has a pink tinge and chemically resembles arsenic and antimony. Of all the metals, it is the most naturally  diamagnetic, and only mercury has less  thermal conductivity. Lead-free bismuth compounds are used in  cosmetics and in medical procedures.
 Notable characteristics
It is a brittle metal with a pinkish hue, often occurring in its native form with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many refractive colors from yellow to blue. Among the  heavy metals, bismuth is unusual in that its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table such as lead, thallium and antimony. No other metal is more naturally  diamagnetic (as opposed to  superdiamagnetic) than bismuth, and it has a high electrical resistance. Of any metal, it has the second lowest  thermal conductivity and the highest  Hall effect. When deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate, bismuth is a semiconductor, rather than a poor metal . When combusted with oxygen, bismuth burns with a  blue flame and  its oxide forms  yellow fumes. Bismuth expands on freezing, and was long an important component of low-melting  typesetting alloys which needed to expand to fill printing molds.While bismuth was traditionally regarded as the element with the heaviest stable  isotope, it had long been thought to be unstable on theoretical grounds. Not until  2003 was this demonstrated when researchers at the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in  Orsay, France, measured the  alpha emission  half-life of 209Bi to be  19 x 1018 years, meaning that bismuth is very slightly radioactive, with a half-life over a billion times longer than the current estimated  age of the universe. Due to its extraordinarily long half-life, for nearly all applications bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and non-radioactive. However, the radioactivity is of academic interest because bismuth is one of few elements whose radioactivity was suspected, and indeed theoretically predicted, before being detected in the laboratory. Crystals
Though virtually unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth can form into distinctive  hopper crystals. These colorful laboratory creations are typically sold to hobbyists. History
Bismuth ( New Latin bisemutum from German Wismuth, perhaps from weiße Masse, "white mass") was confused in early times with tin and lead due to its resemblance to those elements.  Basilius Valentinus described some of its uses in  1450.  Claude François Geoffroy showed in  1753 that this metal is distinct from lead.Artificial bismuth was commonly used in place of the actual mineral. It was made by hammering tin into thin plates, and cementing them by a mixture of  white tartar,  saltpeter, and arsenic, stratified in a crucible over an open fire.  Occurrence
In the Earth's crust, bismuth is about twice as abundant as gold. It is not usually economical to mine it as a primary product. Rather, it is usually produced as a byproduct of the processing of other metal ores, especially lead, but also tungsten or other metal alloys.The most important  ores of bismuth are  bismuthinite and  bismite. The People's Republic of China is the world's largest producer of bismuth, followed by Mexico and Peru. Canada, Bolivia, and Kazakhstan are smaller producers of bismuth.The average price for bismuth in 2000 was US$ 7.70 per kilogram. It is relatively cheap, since like lead (but to a much lesser extent), it is  radiogenic, being formed from the natural decay of uranium and thorium (specifically, by way of neptunium-237 or uranium-233). Applications
Bismuth oxychloride is sometimes used in  cosmetics. Also bismuth subnitrate and bismuth subcarbonate are used in medicine. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol®) is used as an  antidiarrheal and to treat some other gastro-intestinal diseases.Some other current uses are:
Strong permanent magnets can be made from the alloy  bismanol (BiMn).Many bismuth  alloys have low  melting points and are widely used for fire detection and suppression system safety devices.Bismuth is used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons.Bismuth is finding use as a catalyst for making acrylic fibers.A carrier for U-235 or U-233 fuel in  nuclear reactors.Bismuth has also been used in  solders. The fact that bismuth and many of its  alloys expand slightly when they solidify make them ideal for this purpose.Bismuth subnitrate is a component of  glazes that produces an  iridescent luster finish. Bismuth telluride is an excellent  thermoelectric material; it is widely used.As a replacement propellant for xenon in  Hall effect thrusters.
In the early  1990s, research began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications:
As noted above, bismuth has been used in solders; its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment.As a pigment in artist's oil paintAs an ingredient of  Ceramic glazesAs an ingredient in free-machining  brasses for  plumbing applicationsAs an ingredient in free-cutting steels for precision machining propertiesAs a catalyst for making acrylic fibresIn low-melting alloys used in fire detection and extinguishing systemsAs an ingredient in  lubricating  greasesAs a dense material for fishing sinkers.As the oxide, carbonite, or nitrite in crackling microstars ( dragon's eggs) in  pyrotechnics.In 1997 an antibody conjugate with Bi-213, which has a 45 minute half-life, and decays with the emission of an alpha-particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia.As a replacement for lead in  shot and  bullets. The UK,  USA, and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds, as other creatures in the wetlands are prone to  lead poisoning from ingestion of lead shot. Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead (another less expensive but also poorer-performing alternative is steel shot, although some prefer it for the increased damgage it does). Bismuth core bullets are also starting to appear for use in indoor shooting ranges, where particles of lead from the bullet impacting the backstop can be a problem. Due to bismuth's crystaline nature, the bismuth bullets shatter into a non-toxic powder on impact, making recovery and recycling easy. The lack of  malleability does, however, make bismuth unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets. FN Herstal uses bismuth in the projectiles for their  FN 303  less-lethal  riot gun.

Bismuth ( New Latin bisemutum from German Wismuth, perhaps from weiße Masse, "white mass") was confused in early times with tin and lead due to its resemblance to those elements.  Basilius Valentinus described some of its uses in  1450.  Claude François Geoffroy showed in  1753 that this metal is distinct from lead.Artificial bismuth was commonly used in place of the actual mineral. It was made by hammering tin into thin plates, and cementing them by a mixture of  white tartar,  saltpeter, and arsenic, stratified in a crucible over an open fire.  Occurrence
In the Earth's crust, bismuth is about twice as abundant as gold. It is not usually economical to mine it as a primary product. Rather, it is usually produced as a byproduct of the processing of other metal ores, especially lead, but also tungsten or other metal alloys.The most important  ores of bismuth are  bismuthinite and  bismite. The People's Republic of China is the world's largest producer of bismuth, followed by Mexico and Peru. Canada, Bolivia, and Kazakhstan are smaller producers of bismuth.The average price for bismuth in 2000 was US$ 7.70 per kilogram. It is relatively cheap, since like lead (but to a much lesser extent), it is  radiogenic, being formed from the natural decay of uranium and thorium (specifically, by way of neptunium-237 or uranium-233).

As noted above, bismuth has been used in solders; its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment.As a pigment in artist's oil paintAs an ingredient of  Ceramic glazesAs an ingredient in free-machining  brasses for  plumbing applicationsAs an ingredient in free-cutting steels for precision machining propertiesAs a catalyst for making acrylic fibresIn low-melting alloys used in fire detection and extinguishing systemsAs an ingredient in  lubricating  greasesAs a dense material for fishing sinkers.As the oxide, carbonite, or nitrite in crackling microstars ( dragon's eggs) in  pyrotechnics.In 1997 an antibody conjugate with Bi-213, which has a 45 minute half-life, and decays with the emission of an alpha-particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia.As a replacement for lead in  shot and  bullets. The UK,  USA, and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds, as other creatures in the wetlands are prone to  lead poisoning from ingestion of lead shot. Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead (another less expensive but also poorer-performing alternative is steel shot, although some prefer it for the increased damgage it does). Bismuth core bullets are also starting to appear for use in indoor shooting ranges, where particles of lead from the bullet impacting the backstop can be a problem. Due to bismuth's crystaline nature, the bismuth bullets shatter into a non-toxic powder on impact, making recovery and recycling easy. The lack of  malleability does, however, make bismuth unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets. FN Herstal uses bismuth in the projectiles for their  FN 303  less-lethal  riot gun.
