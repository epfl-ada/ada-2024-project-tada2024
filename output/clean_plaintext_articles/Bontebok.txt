Damaliscus pygargus pygargusDamaliscus pygargus phillipsi
The Bontebok is an antelope found in South Africa and Lesotho. The Bontebok has two  subspecies; the Bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygargus), occurring naturally in the  Fynbos and Renosterveld areas of the Western Cape, and the Blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) occurring in the  highveld.The Bontebok stands 80 to 100 centimetres at the shoulder and weighs 50 to 90 kilograms. The Bontebok is a chocolate brown colour, with a white underside and a white stripe from the forehead to the tip of the nose, although there is a brown stripe across the white near the eyes in most Blesbok. Bontebok also has a distinctive white patch around its tail (whence the latin name), while this patch is light brown/tan in Blesbok. The horns of Bontebok are lyre-shaped and clearly ringed they are found in both sexes and can reach a length of half a metre.Blesbok live in highveld where they eat short  grasses, while Bontebok are restricted to coastal Fynbos and Renosterveld (Skead 1980). They are  diurnal, though they rest during the heat of the day. Herds contain only males, only females or are mixed and do not exceed forty animals for Bonteboks or seventy for Blesboks.Bontebok are not good jumpers but they are very good at crawling under things. Mature males form territories and face down other males in displays and occasionally combat.Bontebok were killed as  pests and were reduced to seventeen animals in the wild but have recovered. Blesbok are extinct in their natural  habitat but they have increased in population to the point where they are now  farmed.
