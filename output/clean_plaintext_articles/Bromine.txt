Bromine ( IPA: /ˈbrəʊmiːn/,  Greek: βρωμος, brómos, meaning "stench"), is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Br and  atomic number 35. A  halogen element, bromine is a red  volatile liquid at standard room temperature which has a reactivity between chlorine and iodine. This element is  corrosive to human  tissue in a liquid state and its vapors irritate eyes and throat. Bromine vapors are very  toxic upon inhalation.
 Notable characteristics
Bromine is the only liquid  nonmetallic element at room temperature and one of five elements on the period table that are liquid at or close to room temperature. The pure chemical element has the physical form of a  diatomic molecule, Br2. It is a heavy, mobile, reddish-brown liquid, that evaporates easily at  standard temperature and pressures in a red vapor (its colour resembles  nitrogen dioxide) that has a strong disagreeable odour resembling that of chlorine. A  halogen, bromine resembles chlorine chemically but is less active. It is more active than iodine, however. Bromine is slightly  soluble in  water, and highly soluble in  carbon disulfide,  aliphatic alcohols (such as  methanol), and acetic acid. It  bonds easily with many elements and has a strong  bleaching action.Bromine is highly reactive and is a powerful  oxidizing agent in the presence of water. It reacts vigorously with  amines,  alkenes and  phenols as well as aliphatic and  aromatic  hydrocarbons,  ketones and  acids (these are brominated by either  addition or  substitution reactions). With many of the metals and elements,  anhydrous bromine is less reactive than wet bromine; however, dry bromine reacts vigorously with aluminium, titanium, mercury as well as  alkaline earth metals and  alkaline metals.Due to its contribution to ozone depletion in Earth's atmosphere, bromine has been evaluated to have an ozone depletion potential of 60 when compared to chlorine. Applications
Elemental bromine is used to manufacture a wide variety of bromine compounds used in industry and agriculture. Traditionally the largest use of bromine was in the production of  1,2-dibromoethane which in turn was used as a  gasoline anti- knock agent for leaded gasolines before they were largely phased out due to environmental considerations.Bromine is also used in the manufacture of  fumigants,  brominated flame-retardants, water purification compounds,  dyes,  medicines,  sanitizers,  inorganic bromides for photography, etc. It is also used to form intermediates in organic synthesis, where it is preferred to iodine due to its much lower cost.Bromine is used to make  brominated vegetable oil, which is used as an  emulsifier in many citrus-flavored  soft drinks.Aqueous bromine is orange and can be used in tests for  alkenes and  phenols.
When added to an alkene it will lose its colour as it reacts forming a colorless  bromoalkane. For example, reaction with  ethylene will produce  1,2-dibromoethane.When added to phenol a white  precipitate,  2,4,6-tribromophenol, will form. With aniline, 2,4,6 tribromoaniline will precipitate (even in water)
 History
Bromine was discovered by  Antoine Balard at the  salt marshes of  Montpellier in  1826 but was not produced in quantity until  1860. The French chemist and physicist  Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name bromine due to the characteristic smell of the vapors. Occurrence
Bromine occurs in nature as  bromide salts in very diffuse amounts in crustal rock. Due to  leaching, bromide salts have accumulated in sea water (85  ppm), and may be economically recovered from brine wells and the Dead Sea (up to 5000 ppm).Approximately 500 million kilograms ($350 million USD) of bromine are produced per year (2001) worldwide with the United States and Israel being the primary producers. The largest bromine reserve in the United States is located in  Columbia and  Union County, Arkansas. Safety
Elemental bromine is a strong  irritant and, in concentrated form, will produce painful  blisters on exposed  skin and especially  mucous membranes. Even low concentrations of bromine vapor (from 10 ppm) can affect breathing, and inhalation of significant amounts of bromine can seriously damage the  respiratory system.Accordingly, one should always wear  safety goggles and ensure adequate ventilation when handling bromine.

Bromine was discovered by  Antoine Balard at the  salt marshes of  Montpellier in  1826 but was not produced in quantity until  1860. The French chemist and physicist  Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name bromine due to the characteristic smell of the vapors. Occurrence
Bromine occurs in nature as  bromide salts in very diffuse amounts in crustal rock. Due to  leaching, bromide salts have accumulated in sea water (85  ppm), and may be economically recovered from brine wells and the Dead Sea (up to 5000 ppm).Approximately 500 million kilograms ($350 million USD) of bromine are produced per year (2001) worldwide with the United States and Israel being the primary producers. The largest bromine reserve in the United States is located in  Columbia and  Union County, Arkansas. Safety
Elemental bromine is a strong  irritant and, in concentrated form, will produce painful  blisters on exposed  skin and especially  mucous membranes. Even low concentrations of bromine vapor (from 10 ppm) can affect breathing, and inhalation of significant amounts of bromine can seriously damage the  respiratory system.Accordingly, one should always wear  safety goggles and ensure adequate ventilation when handling bromine. Compounds
 Aluminium bromide (AlBr3),  ammonium bromide (NH4Br),  bromine monofluoride (BrF),  bromine pentafluoride (BrF5),  bromine trifluoride (BrF3),  tetrabromomethane (CBr4),  hydrobromic acid (HBr),  iron(III) bromide (FeBr3),  lithium bromide (LiBr),  phosphorus pentabromide (PBr5), phosphorus tribromide (PBr3),  potassium bromide (KBr),  potassium bromate (KBrO3),  silver bromide (AgBr),  sodium bromide (NaBr),  sodium bromate (NaBrO3).
