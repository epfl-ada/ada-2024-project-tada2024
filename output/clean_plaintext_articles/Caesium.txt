Caesium (also spelled cesium,  IPA: /ˈsiːziəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Cs and  atomic number 55. It is a soft silvery-gold  alkali metal with a melting point of 28 °C (83 °F) which makes it one of the metals that are liquid at or near  room temperature along with rubidium (39°C), francium (27 °C), mercury (-39 °C), and gallium (30 °C). This element is most notably used in  atomic clocks.The variant spelling cesium is sometimes used, especially in  North American English, but caesium is the spelling used by the  IUPAC, although since  1993 it has recognized cesium as a variant as well.
 Notable characteristics
The  electromagnetic spectrum of caesium has two bright lines in the  blue part of the spectrum along with several other lines in the  red,  yellow, and  green. This metal is silvery gold in colour and is both soft and ductile. Caesium is also the most  electropositive and most  alkaline of the stable chemical elements and has the second lowest  ionization potential (francium being the lowest). Caesium is the least abundant of the five non-radioactive alkali metals. (Technically, francium is the least common alkali metal, but since it is highly radioactive with an estimated 340 to 550 grams in the entire earth at one time, its abundance can be considered zero in practical terms.)Along with gallium, francium, and mercury, caesium is among the only metals that are liquid at or near room  temperature. Caesium reacts  explosively in cold  water and also reacts with ice at temperatures above −116°C. Caesium hydroxide (CsOH) is a very strong  base and will rapidly etch the surface of glass. CsOH is often stated to be the "strongest base" (after FrOH), but in fact many compounds such as  n-butyllithium and  sodium amide are stronger.There is an account that caesium, reacting with fluorine, takes up more fluorine than it  stoichometrically should. It is possible that, after the salt Cs+F− has formed, the Cs+ ion, which has the same electronic structure as elemental xenon, can like xenon be oxidised further by fluorine and form traces of a higher fluoride such as CsF3, analogous to XeF2. Applications
Probably the most widespread use of caesium today is in caesium formate-based drilling fluids for the oil industry. The high density of the caesium formate brine (up to 2.3 sg,) coupled with the relative benignity of 133Cs , reduces the requirement for toxic high-density suspended solids in the drilling fluid, which is a significant technological, engineering and environmental advantage. Caesium is also notably used in  atomic clocks, which are accurate to seconds in many thousands of years. Since 1967, the  International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the  second, on the properties of caesium. SI defines the  second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the  radiation which corresponds to the transition between two  electron spin  energy levels of the  ground state of the 133Cs atom.
134Cs has been used in hydrology as a measure of caesium output by the nuclear power industry. This  isotope is used because, while it is less prevalent than either 133Cs or  137Cs, 134Cs can be produced solely by nuclear reactions. 135Cs has also been used in this function.Like other group 1 elements, caesium has a great affinity for oxygen and is used as a " getter" in  vacuum tubes.This metal is also used in  photoelectric cells due to its ready emission of electrons.Caesium is used as a  catalyst in the  hydrogenation of certain  organic compounds. Radioactive isotopes of caesium are used in the medical field to treat certain types of cancer.Caesium fluoride is widely used in  organic chemistry as a  base and as a source of  anhydrous  fluoride ion.Caesium vapor is used in many common  magnetometers.Because of their high density,  caesium chloride solutions are commonly used in molecular biology for density gradient ultracentrifugation, primarily for the isolation of viral particles, subcellular organelles and fractions, and nucleic acids from biological samples.Cesium nitrate is used as  oxidiser to burn silicon in  infrared  flares like the LUU-19 flare, because it emits much of its light in the  near infrared spectrum.More recently this metal has been used in  ion propulsion systems.Caesium-137 is an extremely common radioisotope used as a gamma-emitter in industrial applications such as: 
moisture density gaugesleveling gaugesthickness gaugeswell-logging devices (used to measure the thickness of rock-strata)
also used as an internal standard in spectrophotometry
 History
Caesium (Latin caesius meaning "sky blue" or "light blue") was  spectroscopically discovered by  Robert Bunsen and  Gustav Kirchhoff in  1860 in  mineral water from Dürkheim, Germany. Its identification was based upon the bright blue lines in its spectrum and it was the first element discovered by spectrum analysis. The first caesium metal was produced in  1882 by Carl Setterberg. Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical applications. Occurrence


 Pollucite, a caesium mineral


An alkali metal, caesium occurs in  lepidolite,  pollucite ( hydrated  silicate of aluminium and caesium) and within other sources. One of the world's most significant and rich sources of this metal is located at  Bernic Lake in  Manitoba. The deposits there are estimated to contain 300,000  metric tons of pollucite at an average of 20% caesium.It can be isolated by  electrolysis of fused caesium  cyanide and in a number of other ways. Exceptionally pure and gas-free caesium can be made by the thermal decomposition of caesium  azide. The primary compounds of caesium are  caesium chloride and its  nitrate. The price of caesium metal in 1997 was about $US 30 per gram, but its compounds are much cheaper.
See also  Caesium minerals.
 Isotopes
Caesium has at least 39 known isotopes, which is more than any other element except francium. The  atomic masses of these isotopes range from 112 to 151. Even though this element has a large number of isotopes, it has only one naturally occurring stable  isotope, 133Cs. Most of the other isotopes have  half-lives from a few days to fractions of a second. The  radiogenic isotope  137Cs has been used in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of  3H. 137Cs is produced from the detonation of nuclear weapons and is produced in  nuclear power plants, and notably from the  1986 Chernobyl meltdown. Beginning in 1945 with the commencement of  nuclear testing, 137Cs was released into the atmosphere where it is absorbed readily into solution and is returned to the surface of the earth as a component of  radioactive fallout. Once 137Cs enters the ground water, it is deposited on soil surfaces and removed from the landscape primarily by  particle transport. As a result, the input function of these isotopes can be estimated as a function of time. Caesium-137 has a half-life of 30.17 years. It decomposes to barium-137m (a short-lived product of decay) then to a form of nonradioactive barium. Precautions
All alkaline metals are highly reactive. Caesium, being one of the heavier  alkaline metals, is also one of the most reactive and is highly  explosive when it comes in contact with water (even cold water, or ice).  Caesium hydroxide is an extremely strong  base, and can attack glass.Caesium compounds are encountered rarely by most people. All caesium compounds should be regarded as mildly toxic because of its chemical similarity to potassium. Large amounts cause  hyperirritability and  spasms, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources, so Cs is not a major chemical environmental pollutant. Rats fed caesium in place of potassium in their diet die, so this element cannot replace potassium in function.The  isotopes 134Cs and 137Cs (present in the biosphere in small amounts as a result of radiation leaks) represent a radioactivity burden which varies depending on location. Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as effectively as many other fission products (such as radioiodine and radiostrontium), which are actively accumulated by the body.

 History
Caesium (Latin caesius meaning "sky blue" or "light blue") was  spectroscopically discovered by  Robert Bunsen and  Gustav Kirchhoff in  1860 in  mineral water from Dürkheim, Germany. Its identification was based upon the bright blue lines in its spectrum and it was the first element discovered by spectrum analysis. The first caesium metal was produced in  1882 by Carl Setterberg. Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical applications. Occurrence


 Pollucite, a caesium mineral


An alkali metal, caesium occurs in  lepidolite,  pollucite ( hydrated  silicate of aluminium and caesium) and within other sources. One of the world's most significant and rich sources of this metal is located at  Bernic Lake in  Manitoba. The deposits there are estimated to contain 300,000  metric tons of pollucite at an average of 20% caesium.It can be isolated by  electrolysis of fused caesium  cyanide and in a number of other ways. Exceptionally pure and gas-free caesium can be made by the thermal decomposition of caesium  azide. The primary compounds of caesium are  caesium chloride and its  nitrate. The price of caesium metal in 1997 was about $US 30 per gram, but its compounds are much cheaper.
See also  Caesium minerals.
 Isotopes
Caesium has at least 39 known isotopes, which is more than any other element except francium. The  atomic masses of these isotopes range from 112 to 151. Even though this element has a large number of isotopes, it has only one naturally occurring stable  isotope, 133Cs. Most of the other isotopes have  half-lives from a few days to fractions of a second. The  radiogenic isotope  137Cs has been used in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of  3H. 137Cs is produced from the detonation of nuclear weapons and is produced in  nuclear power plants, and notably from the  1986 Chernobyl meltdown. Beginning in 1945 with the commencement of  nuclear testing, 137Cs was released into the atmosphere where it is absorbed readily into solution and is returned to the surface of the earth as a component of  radioactive fallout. Once 137Cs enters the ground water, it is deposited on soil surfaces and removed from the landscape primarily by  particle transport. As a result, the input function of these isotopes can be estimated as a function of time. Caesium-137 has a half-life of 30.17 years. It decomposes to barium-137m (a short-lived product of decay) then to a form of nonradioactive barium. Precautions
All alkaline metals are highly reactive. Caesium, being one of the heavier  alkaline metals, is also one of the most reactive and is highly  explosive when it comes in contact with water (even cold water, or ice).  Caesium hydroxide is an extremely strong  base, and can attack glass.Caesium compounds are encountered rarely by most people. All caesium compounds should be regarded as mildly toxic because of its chemical similarity to potassium. Large amounts cause  hyperirritability and  spasms, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources, so Cs is not a major chemical environmental pollutant. Rats fed caesium in place of potassium in their diet die, so this element cannot replace potassium in function.The  isotopes 134Cs and 137Cs (present in the biosphere in small amounts as a result of radiation leaks) represent a radioactivity burden which varies depending on location. Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as effectively as many other fission products (such as radioiodine and radiostrontium), which are actively accumulated by the body.

 Caesium hydroxide (CsOH) is a very strong  base and will rapidly etch the surface of glass. CsOH is often stated to be the "strongest base" (after FrOH), but in fact many compounds such as  n-butyllithium and  sodium amide are stronger.There is an account that caesium, reacting with fluorine, takes up more fluorine than it  stoichometrically should. It is possible that, after the salt Cs+F− has formed, the Cs+ ion, which has the same electronic structure as elemental xenon, can like xenon be oxidised further by fluorine and form traces of a higher fluoride such as CsF3, analogous to XeF2. Applications
Probably the most widespread use of caesium today is in caesium formate-based drilling fluids for the oil industry. The high density of the caesium formate brine (up to 2.3 sg,) coupled with the relative benignity of 133Cs , reduces the requirement for toxic high-density suspended solids in the drilling fluid, which is a significant technological, engineering and environmental advantage. Caesium is also notably used in  atomic clocks, which are accurate to seconds in many thousands of years. Since 1967, the  International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the  second, on the properties of caesium. SI defines the  second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the  radiation which corresponds to the transition between two  electron spin  energy levels of the  ground state of the 133Cs atom.

 Isotopes
Caesium has at least 39 known isotopes, which is more than any other element except francium. The  atomic masses of these isotopes range from 112 to 151. Even though this element has a large number of isotopes, it has only one naturally occurring stable  isotope, 133Cs. Most of the other isotopes have  half-lives from a few days to fractions of a second. The  radiogenic isotope  137Cs has been used in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of  3H. 137Cs is produced from the detonation of nuclear weapons and is produced in  nuclear power plants, and notably from the  1986 Chernobyl meltdown. Beginning in 1945 with the commencement of  nuclear testing, 137Cs was released into the atmosphere where it is absorbed readily into solution and is returned to the surface of the earth as a component of  radioactive fallout. Once 137Cs enters the ground water, it is deposited on soil surfaces and removed from the landscape primarily by  particle transport. As a result, the input function of these isotopes can be estimated as a function of time. Caesium-137 has a half-life of 30.17 years. It decomposes to barium-137m (a short-lived product of decay) then to a form of nonradioactive barium. Precautions
All alkaline metals are highly reactive. Caesium, being one of the heavier  alkaline metals, is also one of the most reactive and is highly  explosive when it comes in contact with water (even cold water, or ice).  Caesium hydroxide is an extremely strong  base, and can attack glass.Caesium compounds are encountered rarely by most people. All caesium compounds should be regarded as mildly toxic because of its chemical similarity to potassium. Large amounts cause  hyperirritability and  spasms, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources, so Cs is not a major chemical environmental pollutant. Rats fed caesium in place of potassium in their diet die, so this element cannot replace potassium in function.The  isotopes 134Cs and 137Cs (present in the biosphere in small amounts as a result of radiation leaks) represent a radioactivity burden which varies depending on location. Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as effectively as many other fission products (such as radioiodine and radiostrontium), which are actively accumulated by the body.

 History
Caesium (Latin caesius meaning "sky blue" or "light blue") was  spectroscopically discovered by  Robert Bunsen and  Gustav Kirchhoff in  1860 in  mineral water from Dürkheim, Germany. Its identification was based upon the bright blue lines in its spectrum and it was the first element discovered by spectrum analysis. The first caesium metal was produced in  1882 by Carl Setterberg. Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical applications. Occurrence


 Pollucite, a caesium mineral


An alkali metal, caesium occurs in  lepidolite,  pollucite ( hydrated  silicate of aluminium and caesium) and within other sources. One of the world's most significant and rich sources of this metal is located at  Bernic Lake in  Manitoba. The deposits there are estimated to contain 300,000  metric tons of pollucite at an average of 20% caesium.It can be isolated by  electrolysis of fused caesium  cyanide and in a number of other ways. Exceptionally pure and gas-free caesium can be made by the thermal decomposition of caesium  azide. The primary compounds of caesium are  caesium chloride and its  nitrate. The price of caesium metal in 1997 was about $US 30 per gram, but its compounds are much cheaper.
