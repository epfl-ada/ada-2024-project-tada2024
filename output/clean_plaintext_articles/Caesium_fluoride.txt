Caesium fluoride (cesium fluoride in North America), is an ionic compound usually found as a hygroscopic white solid. It is more soluble and more readily  dissociated than  sodium fluoride or  potassium fluoride. CsF is commercially available – on a lab scale it costs around $50 per 100g ( Synquest), cheaper than RbF. It is available in anhydrous form, and if water has been absorbed it is easy to dry by heating at 100 ° C for two hours  in vacuo. It is therefore a useful, less  hygroscopic alternative to  tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and  TAS-fluoride (TASF) when anhydrous "naked"  fluoride ion is needed. Like all soluble  fluorides, it is mildly  basic. Contact with  acid should be avoided, as this forms highly toxic/corrosive  hydrofluoric acid.
 Chemical Properties
Caesium fluoride reacts usually as a source of  fluoride ion, F-. It therefore undergoes all of the usual reactions associated with soluble  fluorides such as  potassium fluoride, for example:2 CsF ( aq) + CaCl2 ( aq) → 2  CsCl ( aq) +  CaF2 ( s)Being highly dissociated it is quite reactive as a  fluoride source under anhydrous conditions too, and it will react with  electron-deficient  aryl chlorides to form  aryl fluorides ( halex reaction). Due to the strength of the Si-F bond,  fluoride ion is useful for desilylation reactions (removal of Si groups) in  organic chemistry; caesium fluoride is an excellent source of anhydrous fluoride for such reactions (see uses below). As with other soluble  fluorides, CsF is moderately basic, due to the fact that  HF is a weak acid. The low  nucleophilicity of fluoride means it can be a useful base in organic chemistry (see uses below). Preparation
Caesium fluoride may be prepared by the action of  hydrofluoric acid on  caesium hydroxide or  caesium carbonate, followed by removal of water. Uses
Caesium fluoride is a useful base in  organic chemistry, due the fact that  fluoride  ion is largely unreactive as a  nucleophile. It is reported that CsF gives higher yields in  Knoevenagel condensation reactions than  KF or  NaF.Removal of silicon groups (desilylation) is a major application for CsF in the laboratory, as its  anhydrous nature allows clean formation of  water-sensitive intermediates. Caesium fluoride in  THF or  DMF can attack a wide variety of  organosilicon compounds to produce an organosilicon fluoride and a  carbanion, which can then react with  electrophiles, for example: Desilylation is also useful for the removal of  silyl  protecting groups.Caesium fluoride is also a popular source of  fluoride in  organofluorine chemistry. For example, CsF reacts with  hexafluoroacetone to form a caesium perfluoroalkoxide salt which is stable up to 60 ° C, unlike the corresponding sodium or potassium salt.Single crystals of the salt are transparent into the deep  infrared. For this reason it is often used as the windows of cells used for  infrared spectroscopy. Precautions
Like  soluble  fluorides, CsF is moderately toxic, see  Elf Atochem MSDS sheet. Contact with  acid should be avoided, as this forms highly toxic/corrosive  hydrofluoric acid. Caesium  ion (Cs+) per se (for example as  CsCl) is not generally considered toxic. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_fluoride"
