Californium ( IPA: /ˌkalifɔː(r)niəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Cf and  atomic number 98. A  radioactive  transuranic element, californium has very few uses and was discovered by bombarding curium with  alpha particles (helium  ions).
 Notable characteristics
Weighable amounts of californium make it possible to determine some of its properties using macroscopic quantities.252Cf (2.6 year  half-life) is a very strong neutron emitter and is thus extremely  radioactive and harmful (one  microgram spontaneously emits 170 million neutrons per minute). The decay of 254Cf (55-day half-life) may have been detected through telescopes in  supernovae remnants. 249Cf is formed from the  beta decay of 249Bk and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a  nuclear reactor.Californium has no biological role and only a few californium  compounds have been made and studied. Included among these are: californium oxide (Cf2O3), californium trichloride (CfCl3) and californium oxychloride (CfOCl). The only californium ion that is stable in  aqueous solution is the californium(III) cation. General uses
The element does have some specialist applications dealing with its radioactivity but otherwise is largely too difficult to produce to have widespread useful significance as a material. Some of its uses are:
neutron startup source for some  nuclear reactors, calibrating instrumentationtreatment of certain  cervical and  brain cancers where other  radiation therapy is ineffective radiography of aircraft to detect  metal fatigueairport neutron-activation detectors of explosives neutron moisture gauges used to find water and petroleum layers in  oil wellsportable neutron source in gold and silver prospecting for on-the-spot analysis
In October, 2006 it was announced that on three occasions californium-249 atoms had been bombarded with calcium-48 ions to produce ununoctium (element 118), making this the heaviest element ever synthesized. Military use
251Cf is famous for having a very small  critical mass, high lethality, and short period of toxic environmental irradiation relative to radioactive elements commonly used for radiation explosive weaponry, creating speculation about possible use in  pocket nukes. This  urban legend is unfounded since it would be very difficult to make a 251Cf bomb weighing less than 2 kg, and the costs of such a bomb would be prohibitive. Other weaponry uses, such as showering an area with californium, are not impossible but are seen as inhumane and are subject to inclement weather conditions and porous terrain considerations. Often cited as a consideration is the cost of producing californium in quantity, but the cost citations are usually due to extra fees that laboratory materials companies insert for sake of caution and market needs. A government need not consider these as prohibitive. Nuclear fuel cycle
Pertaining to californium's  nuclear fuel cycle, it is important to make sure that the curium concentration in MOX  Nuclear fuel is kept low, as neutron irradation of curium will convert some of it to californium. The californium will then cause the used fuel to be more difficult to handle as the californium is a strong neutron emitter (through spontaneous fission). Hence the concentration of curium and californium among the  Minor actinides are important. History
Californium was  first synthesized by  University of California, Berkeley researchers  Stanley G. Thompson,  Kenneth Street, Jr.,  Albert Ghiorso and  Glenn T. Seaborg in  1950. It was the sixth  transuranium element to be discovered and the team announced their discovery on  March 17, 1950. It was named after the U.S. state of California and for the  University of California system.To produce element 98, the team bombarded a microgram-sized target of 242Cm with 35 MeV  alpha particles in the 60-inch Berkeley  cyclotron which produced atoms of 245Cf (half-life 44 minutes) and a  free neutron. Isotopes
Nineteen  radioisotopes of californium have been characterized, the most stable being 251Cf with a  half-life of 898 years, 249Cf with a half-life of 351 years, and 250Cf with a half-life of 13 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 2.7 years, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes. The isotopes of californium range in  atomic weight from 237.062  amu (237Cf) to 256.093 amu (256Cf). Natural occurrence
Although californium does not occur naturally on Earth, the element and its decay products occur elsewhere in the universe. Their electromagnetic emissions are regularly observed in the spectra of  supernovae. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californium"

Californium was  first synthesized by  University of California, Berkeley researchers  Stanley G. Thompson,  Kenneth Street, Jr.,  Albert Ghiorso and  Glenn T. Seaborg in  1950. It was the sixth  transuranium element to be discovered and the team announced their discovery on  March 17, 1950. It was named after the U.S. state of California and for the  University of California system.To produce element 98, the team bombarded a microgram-sized target of 242Cm with 35 MeV  alpha particles in the 60-inch Berkeley  cyclotron which produced atoms of 245Cf (half-life 44 minutes) and a  free neutron. Isotopes
Nineteen  radioisotopes of californium have been characterized, the most stable being 251Cf with a  half-life of 898 years, 249Cf with a half-life of 351 years, and 250Cf with a half-life of 13 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 2.7 years, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes. The isotopes of californium range in  atomic weight from 237.062  amu (237Cf) to 256.093 amu (256Cf). Natural occurrence
Although californium does not occur naturally on Earth, the element and its decay products occur elsewhere in the universe. Their electromagnetic emissions are regularly observed in the spectra of  supernovae. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californium"




251Cf is famous for having a very small  critical mass, high lethality, and short period of toxic environmental irradiation relative to radioactive elements commonly used for radiation explosive weaponry, creating speculation about possible use in  pocket nukes. This  urban legend is unfounded since it would be very difficult to make a 251Cf bomb weighing less than 2 kg, and the costs of such a bomb would be prohibitive. Other weaponry uses, such as showering an area with californium, are not impossible but are seen as inhumane and are subject to inclement weather conditions and porous terrain considerations. Often cited as a consideration is the cost of producing californium in quantity, but the cost citations are usually due to extra fees that laboratory materials companies insert for sake of caution and market needs. A government need not consider these as prohibitive. Nuclear fuel cycle
Pertaining to californium's  nuclear fuel cycle, it is important to make sure that the curium concentration in MOX  Nuclear fuel is kept low, as neutron irradation of curium will convert some of it to californium. The californium will then cause the used fuel to be more difficult to handle as the californium is a strong neutron emitter (through spontaneous fission). Hence the concentration of curium and californium among the  Minor actinides are important. History
