Celtic Football Club (pronounced "seltik", /sɛltɪk/ in  IPA)  AIM:  CCP is a Scottish football club, competing in the  Scottish Premier League, the highest form of competition in Scotland. The club is based in the east end of the city of Glasgow.The club is officially nicknamed the Bhoys, or unofficially the Hoops. Although the full name of the club is The Celtic Football Club, it is often incorrectly called "Glasgow Celtic" (or "Celtic Glasgow"), particularly by foreign commentators and commentators trying to distinguish between Celtic and other teams with the name Celtic (most notably the  NBA's  Boston Celtics).Celtic play home games at Celtic Park, which is currently the second largest club stadium in the United Kingdom and was until the expansion of  Old Trafford in recent years the largest in the UK. In  2005-06, Celtic Park attracted an average attendance of 58,149  , making Celtic second only to Manchester United   in average attendance for any British football club.Together with their rivals,  Rangers F.C., they form the  Old Firm which is one of the most famous and fiercest rivalries in sport. The club has traditionally been identified with the  Catholic community of Glasgow and has strong support from the Catholic population of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Celtic's home kit is green and white hooped jerseys, white shorts and white socks.In 1967, Celtic became the first British team to win the  European Cup. Before this historic win, no other club in Northern Europe had won the tournament, which had been the preserve of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish clubs. Celtic won every competition that they entered that season: Scottish League,  Scottish FA Cup,  Scottish League Cup,  European Cup and the  Glasgow Cup.Additionally, Celtic remain the only Scottish club ever to have reached the final, and are the only club ever to win the trophy with a team composed entirely of home-grown talent;    all of the players in the side were Scottish, and all were born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park in Glasgow. Celtic again reached the European Cup final in 1970, only to be beaten by  Feyenoord in extra time. In 2003  Martin O'Neill led the team to the  UEFA Cup final in  Seville where they lost 3-2 to  F.C. Porto after extra time. Around 80,000     Celtic supporters travelled to Seville for the final.
 Formation



Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named  Brother Walfrid originally from County  Sligo on  6 November  1887.The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of  Hibernian F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh.On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

The club is officially nicknamed the Bhoys, or unofficially the Hoops. Although the full name of the club is The Celtic Football Club, it is often incorrectly called "Glasgow Celtic" (or "Celtic Glasgow"), particularly by foreign commentators and commentators trying to distinguish between Celtic and other teams with the name Celtic (most notably the  NBA's  Boston Celtics).Celtic play home games at Celtic Park, which is currently the second largest club stadium in the United Kingdom and was until the expansion of  Old Trafford in recent years the largest in the UK. In  2005-06, Celtic Park attracted an average attendance of 58,149  , making Celtic second only to Manchester United   in average attendance for any British football club.Together with their rivals,  Rangers F.C., they form the  Old Firm which is one of the most famous and fiercest rivalries in sport. The club has traditionally been identified with the  Catholic community of Glasgow and has strong support from the Catholic population of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Celtic's home kit is green and white hooped jerseys, white shorts and white socks.In 1967, Celtic became the first British team to win the  European Cup. Before this historic win, no other club in Northern Europe had won the tournament, which had been the preserve of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish clubs. Celtic won every competition that they entered that season: Scottish League,  Scottish FA Cup,  Scottish League Cup,  European Cup and the  Glasgow Cup.Additionally, Celtic remain the only Scottish club ever to have reached the final, and are the only club ever to win the trophy with a team composed entirely of home-grown talent;    all of the players in the side were Scottish, and all were born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park in Glasgow. Celtic again reached the European Cup final in 1970, only to be beaten by  Feyenoord in extra time. In 2003  Martin O'Neill led the team to the  UEFA Cup final in  Seville where they lost 3-2 to  F.C. Porto after extra time. Around 80,000     Celtic supporters travelled to Seville for the final.
 Formation



Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named  Brother Walfrid originally from County  Sligo on  6 November  1887.The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of  Hibernian F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh.On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

Celtic play home games at Celtic Park, which is currently the second largest club stadium in the United Kingdom and was until the expansion of  Old Trafford in recent years the largest in the UK. In  2005-06, Celtic Park attracted an average attendance of 58,149  , making Celtic second only to Manchester United   in average attendance for any British football club.Together with their rivals,  Rangers F.C., they form the  Old Firm which is one of the most famous and fiercest rivalries in sport. The club has traditionally been identified with the  Catholic community of Glasgow and has strong support from the Catholic population of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Celtic's home kit is green and white hooped jerseys, white shorts and white socks.In 1967, Celtic became the first British team to win the  European Cup. Before this historic win, no other club in Northern Europe had won the tournament, which had been the preserve of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish clubs. Celtic won every competition that they entered that season: Scottish League,  Scottish FA Cup,  Scottish League Cup,  European Cup and the  Glasgow Cup.Additionally, Celtic remain the only Scottish club ever to have reached the final, and are the only club ever to win the trophy with a team composed entirely of home-grown talent;    all of the players in the side were Scottish, and all were born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park in Glasgow. Celtic again reached the European Cup final in 1970, only to be beaten by  Feyenoord in extra time. In 2003  Martin O'Neill led the team to the  UEFA Cup final in  Seville where they lost 3-2 to  F.C. Porto after extra time. Around 80,000     Celtic supporters travelled to Seville for the final.
 Formation



Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named  Brother Walfrid originally from County  Sligo on  6 November  1887.The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of  Hibernian F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh.On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

Together with their rivals,  Rangers F.C., they form the  Old Firm which is one of the most famous and fiercest rivalries in sport. The club has traditionally been identified with the  Catholic community of Glasgow and has strong support from the Catholic population of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Celtic's home kit is green and white hooped jerseys, white shorts and white socks.In 1967, Celtic became the first British team to win the  European Cup. Before this historic win, no other club in Northern Europe had won the tournament, which had been the preserve of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish clubs. Celtic won every competition that they entered that season: Scottish League,  Scottish FA Cup,  Scottish League Cup,  European Cup and the  Glasgow Cup.Additionally, Celtic remain the only Scottish club ever to have reached the final, and are the only club ever to win the trophy with a team composed entirely of home-grown talent;    all of the players in the side were Scottish, and all were born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park in Glasgow. Celtic again reached the European Cup final in 1970, only to be beaten by  Feyenoord in extra time. In 2003  Martin O'Neill led the team to the  UEFA Cup final in  Seville where they lost 3-2 to  F.C. Porto after extra time. Around 80,000     Celtic supporters travelled to Seville for the final.
 Formation



Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named  Brother Walfrid originally from County  Sligo on  6 November  1887.The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of  Hibernian F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh.On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

In 1967, Celtic became the first British team to win the  European Cup. Before this historic win, no other club in Northern Europe had won the tournament, which had been the preserve of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish clubs. Celtic won every competition that they entered that season: Scottish League,  Scottish FA Cup,  Scottish League Cup,  European Cup and the  Glasgow Cup.Additionally, Celtic remain the only Scottish club ever to have reached the final, and are the only club ever to win the trophy with a team composed entirely of home-grown talent;    all of the players in the side were Scottish, and all were born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park in Glasgow. Celtic again reached the European Cup final in 1970, only to be beaten by  Feyenoord in extra time. In 2003  Martin O'Neill led the team to the  UEFA Cup final in  Seville where they lost 3-2 to  F.C. Porto after extra time. Around 80,000     Celtic supporters travelled to Seville for the final.
 Formation



Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named  Brother Walfrid originally from County  Sligo on  6 November  1887.The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of  Hibernian F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh.On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season).

Additionally, Celtic remain the only Scottish club ever to have reached the final, and are the only club ever to win the trophy with a team composed entirely of home-grown talent;    all of the players in the side were Scottish, and all were born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park in Glasgow. Celtic again reached the European Cup final in 1970, only to be beaten by  Feyenoord in extra time. In 2003  Martin O'Neill led the team to the  UEFA Cup final in  Seville where they lost 3-2 to  F.C. Porto after extra time. Around 80,000     Celtic supporters travelled to Seville for the final.
 Formation



Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named  Brother Walfrid originally from County  Sligo on  6 November  1887.The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of  Hibernian F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh.On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

 Formation



Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named  Brother Walfrid originally from County  Sligo on  6 November  1887.The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of  Hibernian F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh.On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named  Brother Walfrid originally from County  Sligo on  6 November  1887.The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of  Hibernian F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh.On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

On  28 May  1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter". Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day. The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

 The Old Firm and sectarianism
The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season).

The term  sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural  sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect.Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in issues surrounding  sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism has manifested itself in  sectarian violence; the reproduction of cultural  prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see  History of Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see  Irish-Scots).In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in  social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless, both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with  sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.Some Celtic fans with  Republican sympathies sing  IRA songs at games, and some  Rangers fans, who are traditionally  Loyalist, sing songs such as  Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the  Scottish Parliament,  church groups and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and  surveillance.    In 1996, for instance, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against  Bigotry campaign, later followed by Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds", according to then chief executive Ian McLeod  . Recent seasons
 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

 2003-04
After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season).

After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th championship was delivered.The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

The  2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.Club hero  Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double under  Martin O'Neill.Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's history. 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title.

 2004-05
Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a win at  Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which would have handed them the league.However, Motherwell's  Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals. Rangers defeated  Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee United F.C. in the  Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park.

On  25 May  2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic at the end of  2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford and assistant manager  John Robertson. It was widely reported that O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with  lymphoma.Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager since  Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe. 2005-06
Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Former  Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international  Gordon Strachan from Edinburgh took charge of the club on  1 June  2005, on a 12-month rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

The  Scottish Cup final win against Aberdeen F.C. in 1938 was attended by a crowd of 146,433 at  Hampden Park in Glasgow, which remains a record for a club match in European football.Celtic currently hold the UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from  13 November  1915 until  21 April  1917- a total of 17 months and four days in all (they lost at home to  Kilmarnock F.C. on the last day of the season). Although this was during the 1st World War years.

Celtic also hold the SPL record for an unbeaten run of home matches (77), spanning from 2001 to 2004 (this run was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Aberdeen on  21 April  2004), and the record for the longest run of consecutive wins in a single season (25 matches).Record victory: 11-0, against Dundee in 1895.Record defeat: 0-8 against  Motherwell F.C. in 1937.Record home defeat: 0-5 against  Heart of Midlothian F.C. in 1895.Record post war home defeat 1-5 Aberdeen 1948.The four Record European victories 9-0 KPV Kokkola (Finland), 1970. 8-1 Suduva (Lithuania), 2003. 7-0 Waterford (Rep.Ireland), 1970, 7-0 Valur Rekjavik, 1975.Record European defeat: 0-5 against  FC Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005.Record defeat against Rangers: 1-8 January 1, 1943 (in an unofficial war-time game)Record victory against Rangers: 7-1 1957 Scottish league cup final.Complete record v Rangers P371 W91 D133 L147 F508 A529Record points earned in a season: 72 (Premier Division, 1987/88, 2 points for a Win); 103 (Scottish Premier League, 2001/02, 3 points for a win), which is also the SPL points tally record.Record home attendance: 92,000 against  Rangers F.C. in 1938.

In his first competitive match, against  Artmedia Bratislava on  27 July  2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important  Champions League 2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when the club lost 6-0 to  Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over  Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on  30 July  2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to equalise through a goal by  Craig Beattie.The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive matches for 14 years.In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on  19 November  2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on  8 January  2006 by  First Division side  Clyde F.C.Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

Celtic beat Rangers again on  12 February to make it 17 wins from the previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the  CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over  Dunfermline Athletic on  19 March. They created a new scoring record for the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where  Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993. Club records

On  5 April  2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from  John Hartson in a 1-0 win against  Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six games remaining until the end of the season and before the  SPL split. The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to  Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row. 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.

 2006-07
Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers  Paddy Power took the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the SPL on  4 November  2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On  November 21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the first time since the format was altered in 1993.
