Chlorine ( IPA: /ˈklɔːriːn/,  Greek: χλωρóς chloros, meaning "pale green"), is the chemical element with  atomic number 17 and symbol Cl. It is a  halogen, found in the periodic table in  group 17. As the  chloride ion, which is part of  common salt and other compounds, it is abundant in nature and necessary to most forms of life, including humans. In its elemental form under  standard conditions, it is a pale green gas about 2.5 times as dense as air. It has a disagreeable suffocating odour and is  poisonous. Chlorine is a powerful  oxidant and is used in  bleaching and disinfectants.
 Notable characteristics
Chlorine gas is  diatomic with the formula Cl2. It combines readily with nearly all other elements, although it is not as extremely reactive as fluorine. At 10 ° C one  litre of water dissolves 3.10 litres of gaseous chlorine and at 30 °C only 1.77 litres.This element is a member of the salt-forming halogen series and is extracted from chlorides through  oxidation often by  electrolysis. As the chloride ion, Cl–, it is also the most abundant dissolved species in ocean water. History
Chlorine was discovered in  1774 by Swedish chemist  Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who called it dephlogisticated marine acid (see  Phlogiston theory) and mistakenly thought it contained oxygen. Chlorine was given its current name in  1810 by  Sir Humphry Davy, who insisted that it was in fact an element.Chlorine gas, also known as bertholite, was first  used as a weapon against humans in World War I by Germany on  April 22nd,  1915. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate,  Fritz Haber. It is alleged that his role in the use of chlorine as a deadly weapon drove his wife to suicide. After its first use, it was utilised by both sides as a  chemical weapon. Occurrence
In nature, chlorine is found mainly as the  chloride ion, a component of the salt that is deposited in the earth or dissolved in the oceans—about 1.9% of the mass of seawater is chloride ions. Even higher concentrations of chloride are found in the Dead Sea and in underground  brine deposits. Most chloride salts are soluble in water, thus, chloride-containing minerals are usually only found in abundance in dry climates or deep underground. Common chloride minerals include  halite ( sodium chloride),  sylvite ( potassium chloride), and  carnallite (potassium magnesium chloride hexahydrate).Industrially, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the  electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. Along with chlorine, this  chloralkali process yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide, according to the  chemical equation
2  NaCl + 2 H2O → Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH
 Isotopes
Chlorine has 9 isotopes with mass numbers ranging from 32 to 40. There are two principal stable  isotopes, 35Cl (75.77%) and 37Cl (24.23%), found in the relative proportions of 3:1 respectively, giving chlorine atoms in bulk an apparent atomic weight of 35.5. 36Cl
Trace amounts of  radioactive 36Cl exist in the environment, in a ratio of about 700x10-15 to 1 with stable isotopes. 36Cl is produced in the atmosphere by  spallation of 36Ar by interactions with  cosmic ray protons. In the subsurface environment, 36Cl is generated primarily as a result of  neutron capture by 35Cl or  muon capture by 40Ca. 36Cl decays to 36S and to 36Ar, with a combined  half-life of 308,000 years. The half-life of this  hydrophilic nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for  geologic dating in the range of 60,000 to 1 million years. Additionally, large amounts of 36Cl were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of 36Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and  ground water, 36Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. 36Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments. Chlorine gas extraction
Chlorine can be manufactured by  electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution ( brine). The production of chlorine results in the co-products caustic soda (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H2). These two products, as well as chlorine are highly reactive. There are three industrial methods for the extraction of chlorine by electrolysis. Mercury cell electrolysis
Mercury cell  electrolysis was the first method used to produce chlorine on an industrial scale. Titanium  anodes are located above a liquid mercury cathode and a solution of  sodium chloride is positioned between the electrodes. When an electrical current is applied, chloride is released at the titanium anodes and sodium dissolves into the mercury cathode forming an amalgam.The  amalgam can be  regenerated into mercury by reacting it with water, producing hydrogen and sodium hydroxide. These are useful byproducts. However, this method consumes vast amounts of energy and there are also concerns about mercury  emissions. Diaphragm cell electrolysis
In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an  asbestos diaphragm is deposited on an iron grid cathode preventing the chlorine forming at the anode and the sodium hydroxide forming at the cathode from re-mixing.This method uses less energy than the mercury cell, but the sodium hydroxide is not as easily concentrated and precipitated into a useful substance. Membrane cell electrolysis
The electrolysis cell is divided into two by a membrane acting as an  ion exchanger. Saturated sodium chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment leaving a lower concentration. Sodium hydroxide solution is circulated through the cathode compartment exiting at a higher concentration. A portion of this concentrated sodium hydroxide solution is diverted as product while the remainder is diluted with deionized water and passed through the electrolyzer again.This method is nearly as efficient as the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium hydroxide but requires very pure sodium chloride solution.

Overall equation: 2 NaCl + 2H20 → Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH Other methods
Before electrolytic methods were used for chlorine production, the direct oxidation of  hydrogen chloride with oxygen or air was exercised in the  Deacon process:
4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O
This reaction was accomplished with the use of CuCl2 as a  catalyst. Due to the extremely corrosive reaction mixture, industrial use of this method is difficult.Another earlier process to produce chlorine was to heat brine with acid and  manganese dioxide.
2 NaCl + 2H2SO4 + MnO2 → Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O + Cl2
Using this process, chemist  Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first to isolate chlorine in a laboratory. The manganese can be recovered by the  Weldon process.In a laboratory, small amounts of chlorine gas can be created by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid (typically about 5M) to  sodium chlorate solution. Applications and Uses
 Purification and Disinfection
Chlorine is an important chemical for some processes of water purification, in  disinfectants, and in  bleach. Ozone can also be used for killing bacteria, and is preferred by many municipal drinking water systems because ozone does not form organochlorine compounds and does not remain in the water after treatment.Chlorine is also used widely in the manufacture of many every-day items, or to purify water in various forms.
Used (in the form of  hypochlorous acid) to kill bacteria and other microbes from drinking water supplies and  swimming pools. However, in most non-commercial swimming pools chlorine itself is not used, but rather the mixture sodium hypochloride, a mixture of sodium and chlorine. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated. (See also  chlorination)Used widely in  paper product production,  antiseptic,  dyestuffs, food,  insecticides,  paints, petroleum products,  plastics, medicines, textiles,  solvents, and many other consumer products.
 Oxidizing agent
Chlorine is used extensively in  organic and  inorganic chemistry as an oxidizing agent and in  substitution reactions because chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an  organic compound when it is substituted for hydrogen (as in  synthetic rubber production) because of its high electron affinity. World War I



Chlorine became the first killing agent to be employed during World War I. German chemical conglomerate  IG Farben had been producing chlorine as a by-product of their  dye manufacturing. In cooperation with  Fritz Haber of the  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, they developed methods of discharging chlorine gas against an en trenched enemy. Compounds

Ozone can also be used for killing bacteria, and is preferred by many municipal drinking water systems because ozone does not form organochlorine compounds and does not remain in the water after treatment.Chlorine is also used widely in the manufacture of many every-day items, or to purify water in various forms.
Used (in the form of  hypochlorous acid) to kill bacteria and other microbes from drinking water supplies and  swimming pools. However, in most non-commercial swimming pools chlorine itself is not used, but rather the mixture sodium hypochloride, a mixture of sodium and chlorine. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated. (See also  chlorination)Used widely in  paper product production,  antiseptic,  dyestuffs, food,  insecticides,  paints, petroleum products,  plastics, medicines, textiles,  solvents, and many other consumer products.
 Oxidizing agent
Chlorine is used extensively in  organic and  inorganic chemistry as an oxidizing agent and in  substitution reactions because chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an  organic compound when it is substituted for hydrogen (as in  synthetic rubber production) because of its high electron affinity. World War I



Chlorine became the first killing agent to be employed during World War I. German chemical conglomerate  IG Farben had been producing chlorine as a by-product of their  dye manufacturing. In cooperation with  Fritz Haber of the  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, they developed methods of discharging chlorine gas against an en trenched enemy. Compounds

 History
Chlorine was discovered in  1774 by Swedish chemist  Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who called it dephlogisticated marine acid (see  Phlogiston theory) and mistakenly thought it contained oxygen. Chlorine was given its current name in  1810 by  Sir Humphry Davy, who insisted that it was in fact an element.Chlorine gas, also known as bertholite, was first  used as a weapon against humans in World War I by Germany on  April 22nd,  1915. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate,  Fritz Haber. It is alleged that his role in the use of chlorine as a deadly weapon drove his wife to suicide. After its first use, it was utilised by both sides as a  chemical weapon. Occurrence
In nature, chlorine is found mainly as the  chloride ion, a component of the salt that is deposited in the earth or dissolved in the oceans—about 1.9% of the mass of seawater is chloride ions. Even higher concentrations of chloride are found in the Dead Sea and in underground  brine deposits. Most chloride salts are soluble in water, thus, chloride-containing minerals are usually only found in abundance in dry climates or deep underground. Common chloride minerals include  halite ( sodium chloride),  sylvite ( potassium chloride), and  carnallite (potassium magnesium chloride hexahydrate).Industrially, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the  electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. Along with chlorine, this  chloralkali process yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide, according to the  chemical equation
2  NaCl + 2 H2O → Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH
 Isotopes
Chlorine has 9 isotopes with mass numbers ranging from 32 to 40. There are two principal stable  isotopes, 35Cl (75.77%) and 37Cl (24.23%), found in the relative proportions of 3:1 respectively, giving chlorine atoms in bulk an apparent atomic weight of 35.5. 36Cl
Trace amounts of  radioactive 36Cl exist in the environment, in a ratio of about 700x10-15 to 1 with stable isotopes. 36Cl is produced in the atmosphere by  spallation of 36Ar by interactions with  cosmic ray protons. In the subsurface environment, 36Cl is generated primarily as a result of  neutron capture by 35Cl or  muon capture by 40Ca. 36Cl decays to 36S and to 36Ar, with a combined  half-life of 308,000 years. The half-life of this  hydrophilic nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for  geologic dating in the range of 60,000 to 1 million years. Additionally, large amounts of 36Cl were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of 36Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and  ground water, 36Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. 36Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments. Chlorine gas extraction
Chlorine can be manufactured by  electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution ( brine). The production of chlorine results in the co-products caustic soda (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H2). These two products, as well as chlorine are highly reactive. There are three industrial methods for the extraction of chlorine by electrolysis. Mercury cell electrolysis
Mercury cell  electrolysis was the first method used to produce chlorine on an industrial scale. Titanium  anodes are located above a liquid mercury cathode and a solution of  sodium chloride is positioned between the electrodes. When an electrical current is applied, chloride is released at the titanium anodes and sodium dissolves into the mercury cathode forming an amalgam.The  amalgam can be  regenerated into mercury by reacting it with water, producing hydrogen and sodium hydroxide. These are useful byproducts. However, this method consumes vast amounts of energy and there are also concerns about mercury  emissions. Diaphragm cell electrolysis
In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an  asbestos diaphragm is deposited on an iron grid cathode preventing the chlorine forming at the anode and the sodium hydroxide forming at the cathode from re-mixing.This method uses less energy than the mercury cell, but the sodium hydroxide is not as easily concentrated and precipitated into a useful substance. Membrane cell electrolysis
The electrolysis cell is divided into two by a membrane acting as an  ion exchanger. Saturated sodium chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment leaving a lower concentration. Sodium hydroxide solution is circulated through the cathode compartment exiting at a higher concentration. A portion of this concentrated sodium hydroxide solution is diverted as product while the remainder is diluted with deionized water and passed through the electrolyzer again.This method is nearly as efficient as the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium hydroxide but requires very pure sodium chloride solution.
Cathode: 2 H+(aq) + 2 e– → H2 (g)Anode: 2 Cl– → Cl2 (g) + 2 e–
Overall equation: 2 NaCl + 2H20 → Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH Other methods
Before electrolytic methods were used for chlorine production, the direct oxidation of  hydrogen chloride with oxygen or air was exercised in the  Deacon process:
4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O
This reaction was accomplished with the use of CuCl2 as a  catalyst. Due to the extremely corrosive reaction mixture, industrial use of this method is difficult.Another earlier process to produce chlorine was to heat brine with acid and  manganese dioxide.
2 NaCl + 2H2SO4 + MnO2 → Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O + Cl2
Using this process, chemist  Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first to isolate chlorine in a laboratory. The manganese can be recovered by the  Weldon process.In a laboratory, small amounts of chlorine gas can be created by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid (typically about 5M) to  sodium chlorate solution.

Chlorine is used extensively in  organic and  inorganic chemistry as an oxidizing agent and in  substitution reactions because chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an  organic compound when it is substituted for hydrogen (as in  synthetic rubber production) because of its high electron affinity. World War I



Chlorine became the first killing agent to be employed during World War I. German chemical conglomerate  IG Farben had been producing chlorine as a by-product of their  dye manufacturing. In cooperation with  Fritz Haber of the  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, they developed methods of discharging chlorine gas against an en trenched enemy. Compounds

Chlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials. For more information see an  MSDS. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"




In nature, chlorine is found mainly as the  chloride ion, a component of the salt that is deposited in the earth or dissolved in the oceans—about 1.9% of the mass of seawater is chloride ions. Even higher concentrations of chloride are found in the Dead Sea and in underground  brine deposits. Most chloride salts are soluble in water, thus, chloride-containing minerals are usually only found in abundance in dry climates or deep underground. Common chloride minerals include  halite ( sodium chloride),  sylvite ( potassium chloride), and  carnallite (potassium magnesium chloride hexahydrate).Industrially, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the  electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. Along with chlorine, this  chloralkali process yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide, according to the  chemical equation
2  NaCl + 2 H2O → Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH
 Isotopes
Chlorine has 9 isotopes with mass numbers ranging from 32 to 40. There are two principal stable  isotopes, 35Cl (75.77%) and 37Cl (24.23%), found in the relative proportions of 3:1 respectively, giving chlorine atoms in bulk an apparent atomic weight of 35.5. 36Cl
Trace amounts of  radioactive 36Cl exist in the environment, in a ratio of about 700x10-15 to 1 with stable isotopes. 36Cl is produced in the atmosphere by  spallation of 36Ar by interactions with  cosmic ray protons. In the subsurface environment, 36Cl is generated primarily as a result of  neutron capture by 35Cl or  muon capture by 40Ca. 36Cl decays to 36S and to 36Ar, with a combined  half-life of 308,000 years. The half-life of this  hydrophilic nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for  geologic dating in the range of 60,000 to 1 million years. Additionally, large amounts of 36Cl were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of 36Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and  ground water, 36Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. 36Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments. Chlorine gas extraction
Chlorine can be manufactured by  electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution ( brine). The production of chlorine results in the co-products caustic soda (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H2). These two products, as well as chlorine are highly reactive. There are three industrial methods for the extraction of chlorine by electrolysis. Mercury cell electrolysis
Mercury cell  electrolysis was the first method used to produce chlorine on an industrial scale. Titanium  anodes are located above a liquid mercury cathode and a solution of  sodium chloride is positioned between the electrodes. When an electrical current is applied, chloride is released at the titanium anodes and sodium dissolves into the mercury cathode forming an amalgam.The  amalgam can be  regenerated into mercury by reacting it with water, producing hydrogen and sodium hydroxide. These are useful byproducts. However, this method consumes vast amounts of energy and there are also concerns about mercury  emissions. Diaphragm cell electrolysis
In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an  asbestos diaphragm is deposited on an iron grid cathode preventing the chlorine forming at the anode and the sodium hydroxide forming at the cathode from re-mixing.This method uses less energy than the mercury cell, but the sodium hydroxide is not as easily concentrated and precipitated into a useful substance. Membrane cell electrolysis
The electrolysis cell is divided into two by a membrane acting as an  ion exchanger. Saturated sodium chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment leaving a lower concentration. Sodium hydroxide solution is circulated through the cathode compartment exiting at a higher concentration. A portion of this concentrated sodium hydroxide solution is diverted as product while the remainder is diluted with deionized water and passed through the electrolyzer again.This method is nearly as efficient as the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium hydroxide but requires very pure sodium chloride solution.

Overall equation: 2 NaCl + 2H20 → Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH Other methods
Before electrolytic methods were used for chlorine production, the direct oxidation of  hydrogen chloride with oxygen or air was exercised in the  Deacon process:
4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O
This reaction was accomplished with the use of CuCl2 as a  catalyst. Due to the extremely corrosive reaction mixture, industrial use of this method is difficult.Another earlier process to produce chlorine was to heat brine with acid and  manganese dioxide.
2 NaCl + 2H2SO4 + MnO2 → Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O + Cl2
Using this process, chemist  Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first to isolate chlorine in a laboratory. The manganese can be recovered by the  Weldon process.In a laboratory, small amounts of chlorine gas can be created by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid (typically about 5M) to  sodium chlorate solution. Applications and Uses
 Purification and Disinfection
Chlorine is an important chemical for some processes of water purification, in  disinfectants, and in  bleach. Ozone can also be used for killing bacteria, and is preferred by many municipal drinking water systems because ozone does not form organochlorine compounds and does not remain in the water after treatment.Chlorine is also used widely in the manufacture of many every-day items, or to purify water in various forms.
Used (in the form of  hypochlorous acid) to kill bacteria and other microbes from drinking water supplies and  swimming pools. However, in most non-commercial swimming pools chlorine itself is not used, but rather the mixture sodium hypochloride, a mixture of sodium and chlorine. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.

This reaction was accomplished with the use of CuCl2 as a  catalyst. Due to the extremely corrosive reaction mixture, industrial use of this method is difficult.Another earlier process to produce chlorine was to heat brine with acid and  manganese dioxide.
2 NaCl + 2H2SO4 + MnO2 → Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O + Cl2
Using this process, chemist  Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first to isolate chlorine in a laboratory. The manganese can be recovered by the  Weldon process.In a laboratory, small amounts of chlorine gas can be created by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid (typically about 5M) to  sodium chlorate solution. Applications and Uses
 Purification and Disinfection
Chlorine is an important chemical for some processes of water purification, in  disinfectants, and in  bleach. Ozone can also be used for killing bacteria, and is preferred by many municipal drinking water systems because ozone does not form organochlorine compounds and does not remain in the water after treatment.Chlorine is also used widely in the manufacture of many every-day items, or to purify water in various forms.
Used (in the form of  hypochlorous acid) to kill bacteria and other microbes from drinking water supplies and  swimming pools. However, in most non-commercial swimming pools chlorine itself is not used, but rather the mixture sodium hypochloride, a mixture of sodium and chlorine. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated. (See also  chlorination)Used widely in  paper product production,  antiseptic,  dyestuffs, food,  insecticides,  paints, petroleum products,  plastics, medicines, textiles,  solvents, and many other consumer products.
 Oxidizing agent
Chlorine is used extensively in  organic and  inorganic chemistry as an oxidizing agent and in  substitution reactions because chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an  organic compound when it is substituted for hydrogen (as in  synthetic rubber production) because of its high electron affinity. World War I



Chlorine became the first killing agent to be employed during World War I. German chemical conglomerate  IG Farben had been producing chlorine as a by-product of their  dye manufacturing. In cooperation with  Fritz Haber of the  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, they developed methods of discharging chlorine gas against an en trenched enemy. Compounds

 Other Uses
It is also used in the production of  chlorates,  chloroform,  carbon tetrachloride, and in bromine extraction. Safety

Chlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials. For more information see an  MSDS. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"




Trace amounts of  radioactive 36Cl exist in the environment, in a ratio of about 700x10-15 to 1 with stable isotopes. 36Cl is produced in the atmosphere by  spallation of 36Ar by interactions with  cosmic ray protons. In the subsurface environment, 36Cl is generated primarily as a result of  neutron capture by 35Cl or  muon capture by 40Ca. 36Cl decays to 36S and to 36Ar, with a combined  half-life of 308,000 years. The half-life of this  hydrophilic nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for  geologic dating in the range of 60,000 to 1 million years. Additionally, large amounts of 36Cl were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of 36Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and  ground water, 36Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. 36Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments. Chlorine gas extraction
Chlorine can be manufactured by  electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution ( brine). The production of chlorine results in the co-products caustic soda (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H2). These two products, as well as chlorine are highly reactive. There are three industrial methods for the extraction of chlorine by electrolysis. Mercury cell electrolysis
Mercury cell  electrolysis was the first method used to produce chlorine on an industrial scale. Titanium  anodes are located above a liquid mercury cathode and a solution of  sodium chloride is positioned between the electrodes. When an electrical current is applied, chloride is released at the titanium anodes and sodium dissolves into the mercury cathode forming an amalgam.The  amalgam can be  regenerated into mercury by reacting it with water, producing hydrogen and sodium hydroxide. These are useful byproducts. However, this method consumes vast amounts of energy and there are also concerns about mercury  emissions. Diaphragm cell electrolysis
In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an  asbestos diaphragm is deposited on an iron grid cathode preventing the chlorine forming at the anode and the sodium hydroxide forming at the cathode from re-mixing.This method uses less energy than the mercury cell, but the sodium hydroxide is not as easily concentrated and precipitated into a useful substance. Membrane cell electrolysis
The electrolysis cell is divided into two by a membrane acting as an  ion exchanger. Saturated sodium chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment leaving a lower concentration. Sodium hydroxide solution is circulated through the cathode compartment exiting at a higher concentration. A portion of this concentrated sodium hydroxide solution is diverted as product while the remainder is diluted with deionized water and passed through the electrolyzer again.This method is nearly as efficient as the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium hydroxide but requires very pure sodium chloride solution.

Chlorine became the first killing agent to be employed during World War I. German chemical conglomerate  IG Farben had been producing chlorine as a by-product of their  dye manufacturing. In cooperation with  Fritz Haber of the  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, they developed methods of discharging chlorine gas against an en trenched enemy. Compounds

 Other Uses
It is also used in the production of  chlorates,  chloroform,  carbon tetrachloride, and in bromine extraction. Safety

Chlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials. For more information see an  MSDS. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"




 Diaphragm cell electrolysis
In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an  asbestos diaphragm is deposited on an iron grid cathode preventing the chlorine forming at the anode and the sodium hydroxide forming at the cathode from re-mixing.This method uses less energy than the mercury cell, but the sodium hydroxide is not as easily concentrated and precipitated into a useful substance. Membrane cell electrolysis
The electrolysis cell is divided into two by a membrane acting as an  ion exchanger. Saturated sodium chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment leaving a lower concentration. Sodium hydroxide solution is circulated through the cathode compartment exiting at a higher concentration. A portion of this concentrated sodium hydroxide solution is diverted as product while the remainder is diluted with deionized water and passed through the electrolyzer again.This method is nearly as efficient as the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium hydroxide but requires very pure sodium chloride solution.
Cathode: 2 H+(aq) + 2 e– → H2 (g)Anode: 2 Cl– → Cl2 (g) + 2 e–
Overall equation: 2 NaCl + 2H20 → Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH Other methods
Before electrolytic methods were used for chlorine production, the direct oxidation of  hydrogen chloride with oxygen or air was exercised in the  Deacon process:
4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O
This reaction was accomplished with the use of CuCl2 as a  catalyst. Due to the extremely corrosive reaction mixture, industrial use of this method is difficult.Another earlier process to produce chlorine was to heat brine with acid and  manganese dioxide.
2 NaCl + 2H2SO4 + MnO2 → Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O + Cl2
Using this process, chemist  Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first to isolate chlorine in a laboratory. The manganese can be recovered by the  Weldon process.In a laboratory, small amounts of chlorine gas can be created by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid (typically about 5M) to  sodium chlorate solution. Applications and Uses
 Purification and Disinfection
Chlorine is an important chemical for some processes of water purification, in  disinfectants, and in  bleach. Ozone can also be used for killing bacteria, and is preferred by many municipal drinking water systems because ozone does not form organochlorine compounds and does not remain in the water after treatment.Chlorine is also used widely in the manufacture of many every-day items, or to purify water in various forms.
Used (in the form of  hypochlorous acid) to kill bacteria and other microbes from drinking water supplies and  swimming pools. However, in most non-commercial swimming pools chlorine itself is not used, but rather the mixture sodium hypochloride, a mixture of sodium and chlorine. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated. (See also  chlorination)Used widely in  paper product production,  antiseptic,  dyestuffs, food,  insecticides,  paints, petroleum products,  plastics, medicines, textiles,  solvents, and many other consumer products.

It is also used in the production of  chlorates,  chloroform,  carbon tetrachloride, and in bromine extraction. Safety

Chlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials. For more information see an  MSDS. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"




Before electrolytic methods were used for chlorine production, the direct oxidation of  hydrogen chloride with oxygen or air was exercised in the  Deacon process:
4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O
This reaction was accomplished with the use of CuCl2 as a  catalyst. Due to the extremely corrosive reaction mixture, industrial use of this method is difficult.Another earlier process to produce chlorine was to heat brine with acid and  manganese dioxide.
2 NaCl + 2H2SO4 + MnO2 → Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O + Cl2
Using this process, chemist  Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first to isolate chlorine in a laboratory. The manganese can be recovered by the  Weldon process.In a laboratory, small amounts of chlorine gas can be created by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid (typically about 5M) to  sodium chlorate solution. Applications and Uses
 Purification and Disinfection
Chlorine is an important chemical for some processes of water purification, in  disinfectants, and in  bleach. Ozone can also be used for killing bacteria, and is preferred by many municipal drinking water systems because ozone does not form organochlorine compounds and does not remain in the water after treatment.Chlorine is also used widely in the manufacture of many every-day items, or to purify water in various forms.
Used (in the form of  hypochlorous acid) to kill bacteria and other microbes from drinking water supplies and  swimming pools. However, in most non-commercial swimming pools chlorine itself is not used, but rather the mixture sodium hypochloride, a mixture of sodium and chlorine. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated. (See also  chlorination)Used widely in  paper product production,  antiseptic,  dyestuffs, food,  insecticides,  paints, petroleum products,  plastics, medicines, textiles,  solvents, and many other consumer products.
 Oxidizing agent
Chlorine is used extensively in  organic and  inorganic chemistry as an oxidizing agent and in  substitution reactions because chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an  organic compound when it is substituted for hydrogen (as in  synthetic rubber production) because of its high electron affinity. World War I



Chlorine became the first killing agent to be employed during World War I. German chemical conglomerate  IG Farben had been producing chlorine as a by-product of their  dye manufacturing. In cooperation with  Fritz Haber of the  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, they developed methods of discharging chlorine gas against an en trenched enemy. Compounds
