 Notable characteristics


 Chromium


Chromium is a steel-gray, lustrous, hard metal that takes a high polish, and has a high melting point. It is also odourless, tasteless, and is somewhat malleable.The most common  oxidation states of chromium are +2, +3, and +6, with +3 being the most stable. +1, +4 and +5 are rare. Chromium compounds of oxidation state 6 are powerful oxidants.Chromium is passive with oxygen, i.e. forms a very thin, insoluble, protective oxide which prevents further oxidation of the underlying metal. Applications
Uses of chromium:
In metallurgy, to impart corrosion resistance and a shiny finish :- 
as an  alloy constituent, such as in  stainless steel in  cutleryin  chrome plating,in  anodized aluminium, literally turning the surface of aluminium into  ruby.
As dyes and  paints :- 
 Chromium(III) oxide is a metal polish known as  green rouge.Chromium salts colour glass an  emerald green.Chromium is what makes a  ruby red, and therefore is used in producing synthetic rubies.also makes a brilliant yellow for painting
As a  catalyst. Chromite is used to make molds for the firing of  bricks.Chromium salts are used in the  tanning of  leather.Potassium dichromate is a chemical  reagent, used in cleaning  laboratory glassware and as a titrating agent. It is also used as a  mordant (i.e., a fixing agent) for dyes in fabric. Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) is used to manufacture  magnetic tape, where its higher  coercivity than iron oxide tapes gives better performance.In well drilling muds as an anti-corrosive.In medicine, as a dietary supplement or slimming aid, usually as chromium (III) chloride or  chromium(III) picolinate.
 History
In 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the  Ural Mountains which he named Siberian red lead. Though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components, the material was in fact lead chromate with a formula of PbCrO4, now known as the mineral  crocoite.In 1770,  Peter Simon Pallas visited the same site as Lehmann and found a red "lead" mineral that had very useful properties as a pigment in  paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment developed rapidly. A bright  yellow made from crocoite became a colour in fashion.In 1797,  Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin received samples of crocoite  ore. He was able to produce  chromium oxide with a chemical formula of CrO3, by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid. In 1798, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven. He was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious  gemstones, such as  ruby, or  emerald.During the 1800s chromium was primarily used as a component of paints and in  tanning salts but now the primary use in is for metal alloys and is responsible for 85% of the use of chromium. The remainder is used in the  chemical industry and  refractory and  foundry industries.Chromium was named after the Greek word "chroma" meaning colour, because of the many colorful compounds made from it. Biological role
Trivalent chromium (Cr(III), or Cr3+) is required in trace amounts for sugar  metabolism in humans, and its deficiency can cause  chromium deficiency. In contrast,  hexavalent chromium is very toxic. Occurrence
Chromium is mined as  chromite (FeCr2O4) ore. Roughly half the chromite ore in the world is produced in South Africa. Kazakhstan, India and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are plentiful, but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.Approximately 15 million tons of marketable chromite ore were produced in 2000, and converted into approximately 4 million tons of ferro-chrome with an approximate market value of 2.5 billion United States dollars.Though native chromium deposits are rare, some native chromium metal has been discovered. The Udachnaya Mine in Russia produces samples of the native metal. This mine is a  kimberlite pipe rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment so provided helped produce both elemental chromium and diamond. Isolation
Chromium is obtained commercially by heating the  ore in the presence of aluminium or silicon. Compounds
 Potassium dichromate is a powerful oxidizing agent and is the preferred compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any possible organics. It is used as a saturated solution in concentrated sulphuric acid for washing the apparatus. For this purpose, however,  sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (5 g/100 ml vs. 20 g/100 ml respectively). Chrome green is the green oxide of chromium, Cr2O3, used in  enamel painting, and glass staining. Chrome yellow is a brilliant yellow pigment, PbCrO4, used by painters. Chromic acid has the hypothetical structure H2CrO4. Neither chromic nor dichromic acid is found in nature, but their anions are found in a variety of compounds. Chromium trioxide, CrO3, the acid  anhydride of chromic acid, is sold industrially as "chromic acid". Chromium and the quintuple bond
Chromium is notable for its ability to form quintuple  covalent bonds. Writing in  Science,  Tailuan Nguyen, a graduate student working with  Philip Power of the  University of California, Davis describes the synthesis of a compound of chromium(I) and a  hydrocarbon  radical which was shown via  X-ray diffraction to contain a quintuple bond of length 183.51(4) pm (1.835 angstroms) joining the two central chromium atoms. This was accomplished through the use of an extremely bulky monodentate ligand which through its sheer size, is able to prevent further coordination. Chromium currently remains the only element for which quintuple bonds have been observed.The compound had the  Lewis structure
Ar − Cr − Cr − Ar
where Ar is the  aryl group  (Pri is  isopropyl)
 Isotopes
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of 3 stable  isotopes; 52Cr, 53Cr, and 54Cr with 52Cr being the most abundant (83.789%  natural abundance). 19  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 50Cr with a  half-life of (more than) 1.8x1017 years, and 51Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 24 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2  meta states.53Cr is the  radiogenic decay product of 53Mn. Chromium  isotopic contents are typically combined with manganese isotopic contents and have found application in  isotope geology. Mn-Cr isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotope systematics must result from in-situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence 53Cr provides additional evidence for  nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.The isotopes of chromium range in  atomic weight from 43  amu (43Cr) to 67 amu (67Cr). The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 52Cr, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta decay. Precautions
Chromium metal and chromium(III) compounds are not usually considered health hazards, but  hexavalent chromium (chromium VI) compounds can be  toxic if orally ingested or inhaled. The lethal dose of poisonous chromium (VI) compounds is about one half teaspoon of material. Most chromium (VI) compounds are irritating to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Chronic exposure to chromium (VI) compounds can cause permanent eye injury, unless properly treated. Chromium(VI) is an established human  carcinogen. An investigation into hexavalent chromium release into drinking water formed the plot of the motion picture  Erin Brockovich.World Health Organization recommended  maximum allowable concentration in drinking water for chromium (VI) is 0.05  milligrams per  liter.As chromium compounds were used in  dyes and  paints and the  tanning of  leather, these compounds are often found in soil and  groundwater at abandoned industrial site, now needing  environmental cleanup and  remediation per the treatment of  brownfield land.  Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for  aerospace and automobile refinishing applications. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"

 History
In 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the  Ural Mountains which he named Siberian red lead. Though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components, the material was in fact lead chromate with a formula of PbCrO4, now known as the mineral  crocoite.In 1770,  Peter Simon Pallas visited the same site as Lehmann and found a red "lead" mineral that had very useful properties as a pigment in  paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment developed rapidly. A bright  yellow made from crocoite became a colour in fashion.In 1797,  Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin received samples of crocoite  ore. He was able to produce  chromium oxide with a chemical formula of CrO3, by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid. In 1798, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven. He was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious  gemstones, such as  ruby, or  emerald.During the 1800s chromium was primarily used as a component of paints and in  tanning salts but now the primary use in is for metal alloys and is responsible for 85% of the use of chromium. The remainder is used in the  chemical industry and  refractory and  foundry industries.Chromium was named after the Greek word "chroma" meaning colour, because of the many colorful compounds made from it. Biological role
Trivalent chromium (Cr(III), or Cr3+) is required in trace amounts for sugar  metabolism in humans, and its deficiency can cause  chromium deficiency. In contrast,  hexavalent chromium is very toxic. Occurrence
Chromium is mined as  chromite (FeCr2O4) ore. Roughly half the chromite ore in the world is produced in South Africa. Kazakhstan, India and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are plentiful, but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.Approximately 15 million tons of marketable chromite ore were produced in 2000, and converted into approximately 4 million tons of ferro-chrome with an approximate market value of 2.5 billion United States dollars.Though native chromium deposits are rare, some native chromium metal has been discovered. The Udachnaya Mine in Russia produces samples of the native metal. This mine is a  kimberlite pipe rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment so provided helped produce both elemental chromium and diamond. Isolation
Chromium is obtained commercially by heating the  ore in the presence of aluminium or silicon. Compounds
 Potassium dichromate is a powerful oxidizing agent and is the preferred compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any possible organics. It is used as a saturated solution in concentrated sulphuric acid for washing the apparatus. For this purpose, however,  sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (5 g/100 ml vs. 20 g/100 ml respectively). Chrome green is the green oxide of chromium, Cr2O3, used in  enamel painting, and glass staining. Chrome yellow is a brilliant yellow pigment, PbCrO4, used by painters. Chromic acid has the hypothetical structure H2CrO4. Neither chromic nor dichromic acid is found in nature, but their anions are found in a variety of compounds. Chromium trioxide, CrO3, the acid  anhydride of chromic acid, is sold industrially as "chromic acid". Chromium and the quintuple bond
Chromium is notable for its ability to form quintuple  covalent bonds. Writing in  Science,  Tailuan Nguyen, a graduate student working with  Philip Power of the  University of California, Davis describes the synthesis of a compound of chromium(I) and a  hydrocarbon  radical which was shown via  X-ray diffraction to contain a quintuple bond of length 183.51(4) pm (1.835 angstroms) joining the two central chromium atoms. This was accomplished through the use of an extremely bulky monodentate ligand which through its sheer size, is able to prevent further coordination. Chromium currently remains the only element for which quintuple bonds have been observed.The compound had the  Lewis structure
Ar − Cr − Cr − Ar
where Ar is the  aryl group  (Pri is  isopropyl)
 Isotopes
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of 3 stable  isotopes; 52Cr, 53Cr, and 54Cr with 52Cr being the most abundant (83.789%  natural abundance). 19  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 50Cr with a  half-life of (more than) 1.8x1017 years, and 51Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 24 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2  meta states.53Cr is the  radiogenic decay product of 53Mn. Chromium  isotopic contents are typically combined with manganese isotopic contents and have found application in  isotope geology. Mn-Cr isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotope systematics must result from in-situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence 53Cr provides additional evidence for  nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.The isotopes of chromium range in  atomic weight from 43  amu (43Cr) to 67 amu (67Cr). The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 52Cr, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta decay. Precautions
Chromium metal and chromium(III) compounds are not usually considered health hazards, but  hexavalent chromium (chromium VI) compounds can be  toxic if orally ingested or inhaled. The lethal dose of poisonous chromium (VI) compounds is about one half teaspoon of material. Most chromium (VI) compounds are irritating to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Chronic exposure to chromium (VI) compounds can cause permanent eye injury, unless properly treated. Chromium(VI) is an established human  carcinogen. An investigation into hexavalent chromium release into drinking water formed the plot of the motion picture  Erin Brockovich.World Health Organization recommended  maximum allowable concentration in drinking water for chromium (VI) is 0.05  milligrams per  liter.As chromium compounds were used in  dyes and  paints and the  tanning of  leather, these compounds are often found in soil and  groundwater at abandoned industrial site, now needing  environmental cleanup and  remediation per the treatment of  brownfield land.  Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for  aerospace and automobile refinishing applications. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"

Naturally occurring chromium is composed of 3 stable  isotopes; 52Cr, 53Cr, and 54Cr with 52Cr being the most abundant (83.789%  natural abundance). 19  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 50Cr with a  half-life of (more than) 1.8x1017 years, and 51Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 24 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2  meta states.53Cr is the  radiogenic decay product of 53Mn. Chromium  isotopic contents are typically combined with manganese isotopic contents and have found application in  isotope geology. Mn-Cr isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotope systematics must result from in-situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence 53Cr provides additional evidence for  nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.The isotopes of chromium range in  atomic weight from 43  amu (43Cr) to 67 amu (67Cr). The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 52Cr, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta decay. Precautions
Chromium metal and chromium(III) compounds are not usually considered health hazards, but  hexavalent chromium (chromium VI) compounds can be  toxic if orally ingested or inhaled. The lethal dose of poisonous chromium (VI) compounds is about one half teaspoon of material. Most chromium (VI) compounds are irritating to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Chronic exposure to chromium (VI) compounds can cause permanent eye injury, unless properly treated. Chromium(VI) is an established human  carcinogen. An investigation into hexavalent chromium release into drinking water formed the plot of the motion picture  Erin Brockovich.World Health Organization recommended  maximum allowable concentration in drinking water for chromium (VI) is 0.05  milligrams per  liter.As chromium compounds were used in  dyes and  paints and the  tanning of  leather, these compounds are often found in soil and  groundwater at abandoned industrial site, now needing  environmental cleanup and  remediation per the treatment of  brownfield land.  Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for  aerospace and automobile refinishing applications. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"




In 1770,  Peter Simon Pallas visited the same site as Lehmann and found a red "lead" mineral that had very useful properties as a pigment in  paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment developed rapidly. A bright  yellow made from crocoite became a colour in fashion.In 1797,  Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin received samples of crocoite  ore. He was able to produce  chromium oxide with a chemical formula of CrO3, by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid. In 1798, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven. He was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious  gemstones, such as  ruby, or  emerald.During the 1800s chromium was primarily used as a component of paints and in  tanning salts but now the primary use in is for metal alloys and is responsible for 85% of the use of chromium. The remainder is used in the  chemical industry and  refractory and  foundry industries.Chromium was named after the Greek word "chroma" meaning colour, because of the many colorful compounds made from it. Biological role
Trivalent chromium (Cr(III), or Cr3+) is required in trace amounts for sugar  metabolism in humans, and its deficiency can cause  chromium deficiency. In contrast,  hexavalent chromium is very toxic. Occurrence
Chromium is mined as  chromite (FeCr2O4) ore. Roughly half the chromite ore in the world is produced in South Africa. Kazakhstan, India and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are plentiful, but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.Approximately 15 million tons of marketable chromite ore were produced in 2000, and converted into approximately 4 million tons of ferro-chrome with an approximate market value of 2.5 billion United States dollars.Though native chromium deposits are rare, some native chromium metal has been discovered. The Udachnaya Mine in Russia produces samples of the native metal. This mine is a  kimberlite pipe rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment so provided helped produce both elemental chromium and diamond. Isolation
Chromium is obtained commercially by heating the  ore in the presence of aluminium or silicon. Compounds
 Potassium dichromate is a powerful oxidizing agent and is the preferred compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any possible organics. It is used as a saturated solution in concentrated sulphuric acid for washing the apparatus. For this purpose, however,  sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (5 g/100 ml vs. 20 g/100 ml respectively). Chrome green is the green oxide of chromium, Cr2O3, used in  enamel painting, and glass staining. Chrome yellow is a brilliant yellow pigment, PbCrO4, used by painters. Chromic acid has the hypothetical structure H2CrO4. Neither chromic nor dichromic acid is found in nature, but their anions are found in a variety of compounds. Chromium trioxide, CrO3, the acid  anhydride of chromic acid, is sold industrially as "chromic acid". Chromium and the quintuple bond
Chromium is notable for its ability to form quintuple  covalent bonds. Writing in  Science,  Tailuan Nguyen, a graduate student working with  Philip Power of the  University of California, Davis describes the synthesis of a compound of chromium(I) and a  hydrocarbon  radical which was shown via  X-ray diffraction to contain a quintuple bond of length 183.51(4) pm (1.835 angstroms) joining the two central chromium atoms. This was accomplished through the use of an extremely bulky monodentate ligand which through its sheer size, is able to prevent further coordination. Chromium currently remains the only element for which quintuple bonds have been observed.The compound had the  Lewis structure
Ar − Cr − Cr − Ar

Naturally occurring chromium is composed of 3 stable  isotopes; 52Cr, 53Cr, and 54Cr with 52Cr being the most abundant (83.789%  natural abundance). 19  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 50Cr with a  half-life of (more than) 1.8x1017 years, and 51Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 24 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2  meta states.53Cr is the  radiogenic decay product of 53Mn. Chromium  isotopic contents are typically combined with manganese isotopic contents and have found application in  isotope geology. Mn-Cr isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotope systematics must result from in-situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence 53Cr provides additional evidence for  nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.The isotopes of chromium range in  atomic weight from 43  amu (43Cr) to 67 amu (67Cr). The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 52Cr, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta decay. Precautions
Chromium metal and chromium(III) compounds are not usually considered health hazards, but  hexavalent chromium (chromium VI) compounds can be  toxic if orally ingested or inhaled. The lethal dose of poisonous chromium (VI) compounds is about one half teaspoon of material. Most chromium (VI) compounds are irritating to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Chronic exposure to chromium (VI) compounds can cause permanent eye injury, unless properly treated. Chromium(VI) is an established human  carcinogen. An investigation into hexavalent chromium release into drinking water formed the plot of the motion picture  Erin Brockovich.World Health Organization recommended  maximum allowable concentration in drinking water for chromium (VI) is 0.05  milligrams per  liter.As chromium compounds were used in  dyes and  paints and the  tanning of  leather, these compounds are often found in soil and  groundwater at abandoned industrial site, now needing  environmental cleanup and  remediation per the treatment of  brownfield land.  Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for  aerospace and automobile refinishing applications. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"




 Occurrence
Chromium is mined as  chromite (FeCr2O4) ore. Roughly half the chromite ore in the world is produced in South Africa. Kazakhstan, India and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are plentiful, but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.Approximately 15 million tons of marketable chromite ore were produced in 2000, and converted into approximately 4 million tons of ferro-chrome with an approximate market value of 2.5 billion United States dollars.Though native chromium deposits are rare, some native chromium metal has been discovered. The Udachnaya Mine in Russia produces samples of the native metal. This mine is a  kimberlite pipe rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment so provided helped produce both elemental chromium and diamond. Isolation
Chromium is obtained commercially by heating the  ore in the presence of aluminium or silicon. Compounds
 Potassium dichromate is a powerful oxidizing agent and is the preferred compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any possible organics. It is used as a saturated solution in concentrated sulphuric acid for washing the apparatus. For this purpose, however,  sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (5 g/100 ml vs. 20 g/100 ml respectively). Chrome green is the green oxide of chromium, Cr2O3, used in  enamel painting, and glass staining. Chrome yellow is a brilliant yellow pigment, PbCrO4, used by painters. Chromic acid has the hypothetical structure H2CrO4. Neither chromic nor dichromic acid is found in nature, but their anions are found in a variety of compounds. Chromium trioxide, CrO3, the acid  anhydride of chromic acid, is sold industrially as "chromic acid". Chromium and the quintuple bond
Chromium is notable for its ability to form quintuple  covalent bonds. Writing in  Science,  Tailuan Nguyen, a graduate student working with  Philip Power of the  University of California, Davis describes the synthesis of a compound of chromium(I) and a  hydrocarbon  radical which was shown via  X-ray diffraction to contain a quintuple bond of length 183.51(4) pm (1.835 angstroms) joining the two central chromium atoms. This was accomplished through the use of an extremely bulky monodentate ligand which through its sheer size, is able to prevent further coordination. Chromium currently remains the only element for which quintuple bonds have been observed.The compound had the  Lewis structure
Ar − Cr − Cr − Ar
where Ar is the  aryl group  (Pri is  isopropyl)

Chromium metal and chromium(III) compounds are not usually considered health hazards, but  hexavalent chromium (chromium VI) compounds can be  toxic if orally ingested or inhaled. The lethal dose of poisonous chromium (VI) compounds is about one half teaspoon of material. Most chromium (VI) compounds are irritating to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Chronic exposure to chromium (VI) compounds can cause permanent eye injury, unless properly treated. Chromium(VI) is an established human  carcinogen. An investigation into hexavalent chromium release into drinking water formed the plot of the motion picture  Erin Brockovich.World Health Organization recommended  maximum allowable concentration in drinking water for chromium (VI) is 0.05  milligrams per  liter.As chromium compounds were used in  dyes and  paints and the  tanning of  leather, these compounds are often found in soil and  groundwater at abandoned industrial site, now needing  environmental cleanup and  remediation per the treatment of  brownfield land.  Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for  aerospace and automobile refinishing applications. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"




 Potassium dichromate is a powerful oxidizing agent and is the preferred compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any possible organics. It is used as a saturated solution in concentrated sulphuric acid for washing the apparatus. For this purpose, however,  sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (5 g/100 ml vs. 20 g/100 ml respectively). Chrome green is the green oxide of chromium, Cr2O3, used in  enamel painting, and glass staining. Chrome yellow is a brilliant yellow pigment, PbCrO4, used by painters. Chromic acid has the hypothetical structure H2CrO4. Neither chromic nor dichromic acid is found in nature, but their anions are found in a variety of compounds. Chromium trioxide, CrO3, the acid  anhydride of chromic acid, is sold industrially as "chromic acid". Chromium and the quintuple bond
Chromium is notable for its ability to form quintuple  covalent bonds. Writing in  Science,  Tailuan Nguyen, a graduate student working with  Philip Power of the  University of California, Davis describes the synthesis of a compound of chromium(I) and a  hydrocarbon  radical which was shown via  X-ray diffraction to contain a quintuple bond of length 183.51(4) pm (1.835 angstroms) joining the two central chromium atoms. This was accomplished through the use of an extremely bulky monodentate ligand which through its sheer size, is able to prevent further coordination. Chromium currently remains the only element for which quintuple bonds have been observed.The compound had the  Lewis structure
Ar − Cr − Cr − Ar
where Ar is the  aryl group  (Pri is  isopropyl)
 Isotopes
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of 3 stable  isotopes; 52Cr, 53Cr, and 54Cr with 52Cr being the most abundant (83.789%  natural abundance). 19  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 50Cr with a  half-life of (more than) 1.8x1017 years, and 51Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 24 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2  meta states.53Cr is the  radiogenic decay product of 53Mn. Chromium  isotopic contents are typically combined with manganese isotopic contents and have found application in  isotope geology. Mn-Cr isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotope systematics must result from in-situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence 53Cr provides additional evidence for  nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.The isotopes of chromium range in  atomic weight from 43  amu (43Cr) to 67 amu (67Cr).

Chronic exposure to chromium (VI) compounds can cause permanent eye injury, unless properly treated. Chromium(VI) is an established human  carcinogen. An investigation into hexavalent chromium release into drinking water formed the plot of the motion picture  Erin Brockovich.World Health Organization recommended  maximum allowable concentration in drinking water for chromium (VI) is 0.05  milligrams per  liter.As chromium compounds were used in  dyes and  paints and the  tanning of  leather, these compounds are often found in soil and  groundwater at abandoned industrial site, now needing  environmental cleanup and  remediation per the treatment of  brownfield land.  Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for  aerospace and automobile refinishing applications. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"
