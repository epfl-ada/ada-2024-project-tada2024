The Clifton Suspension Bridge is a  suspension bridge, spanning the Avon Gorge and linking  Clifton in Bristol to  Leigh Woods in  North Somerset, UK. Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it is a distinctive  landmark that is often used as a symbol of Bristol. It is a grade I  listed building.The bridge has long had a reputation as a  suicide spot. Because of this, dedicated telephones with a direct line to  The Samaritans were placed beside the bridge. However, the phones have since been vandalised and there are now only wires dangling from where the phones once hung. In  1885, a 22 year old woman called Sarah Ann Henley survived a jump from the bridge when her billowing  skirts acted as a  parachute, and subsequently lived into her eighties.
 History
The idea of building a bridge across the Avon Gorge originated in  1754, with a bequest in the will of Bristolian merchant  William Vick, who left £1,000 invested with instructions that when the  interest had accumulated to £10,000, it should be used for the purpose of building a stone bridge between  Clifton Down (which was in  Gloucestershire, outside the City of Bristol, until the 1830s) and Leigh Woods (then in  Somerset), both of which were barely populated at the time.

By the  1820s, Vick's bequest was nearing £8,000, but it was estimated that a stone bridge would cost over ten times that amount. An  Act of Parliament was passed to allow a wrought-iron suspension bridge to be built instead, and tolls levied to recoup the cost. In  1829, a competition was held to find a design for the bridge; the judge,  Thomas Telford, rejected all designs, and tried to insist on a hugely expensive design of his own. A second competition, held with new judges, was won by Brunel's design, for a suspension bridge with fashionably Egyptian-influenced towers.An attempt to build Brunel's design in  1831 was stopped by the  Bristol Riots, which severely dented commercial confidence in Bristol. Work was not started again until  1836, and thereafter the capital from Vick's bequest and subsequent investment proved woefully inadequate. By  1843, the towers had been built in unfinished stone, but funds were exhausted. In  1851, the ironwork was sold and used to build the Brunel-designed  Royal Albert Bridge on the railway between Plymouth and  Saltash.Brunel died in  1859, without seeing the completion of the bridge. Brunel's colleagues in the  Institution of Civil Engineers felt that completion of the Bridge would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds. In  1860, Brunel's  Hungerford suspension bridge, over the Thames in London, was demolished to make way for a new railway bridge to  Charing Cross railway station, and its chains were purchased for use at Clifton. A slightly revised design was made by  William Henry Barlow and Sir  John Hawkshaw; it has a wider, higher and sturdier deck than Brunel intended, triple chains instead of double, and the towers were left as rough stone rather than being finished in Egyptian style. Work on the bridge was restarted in  1862, and was complete by  1864. The bridge has been open continuously since then.The bridge is now managed by a trust set up by Act of Parliament in  1952.  Tolls are levied on vehicles but no longer on  cyclists or  pedestrians. The bridge is usually illuminated at night, with a modernised,  LED-based array switched on for the first time on  8 April  2006, to an accompaniment of fireworks and festivities. This was after an extended period of much reduced lighting, and timed to coincide with the  bicentenary of Brunel's birth.On  26 November  2003, the last ever Concorde flight (Concorde 216) flew over the bridge before landing at  Filton Airfield. It was a symbolic moment which commemorated Bristol's past feats in engineering.

In  2002 it was discovered that the large red  sandstone abutment on the Leigh Woods side is not (as had been thought for many years) solid stone, but has twelve vaulted chambers up to 35 ft (11 m) high within it. In 2003 the weight of crowds returning from the  Ashton Court festival and  Bristol International Balloon Fiesta put such great strain on the bridge that it was decided to close the bridge to all traffic, including pedestrians, during the whole of the Ashton Court Festival and part of the Balloon Fiesta in  2004.
