Copper(I) chloride (quite commonly called cuprous chloride), is the lower  chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. It occurs naturally as the mineral  nantokite. It is a white solid which is almost insoluble in water, and which tends to  oxidise in air to green  CuCl2. It is a  Lewis acid which reacts with suitable ligands such as ammonia or  chloride ion to form  complexes, many of which are water-soluble. It is even able to form a stable complex with  carbon monoxide.In  aqueous solution, CuCl would be unstable with respect to  disproportionation into Cu and  CuCl2, but its low  solubility allows it to be a stable compound.
 Chemical Properties
Copper(I) chloride is a  Lewis acid, classified as soft according to the  Hard-Soft Acid-Base concept. Thus it tends to form stable  complexes with soft  Lewis bases such as  triphenylphosphine:CuCl +  PPh3 → [CuCl(PPh3)]4 (Ph =  phenyl)Although CuCl is insoluble in water, it dissolves in aqueous solutions containing suitable donor molecules. It readily forms complexes with  halide ions, for example forming  H3O+ CuCl2- with concentrated hydrochloric acid. It also dissolves readily in solutions containing  CN-,  S2O32- or NH3Solutions of CuCl in HCl or NH3 absorb  carbon monoxide to form colourless  complexes such as the crystalline halogen-bridged dimer [CuCl(CO)]2. The same HCl solution can also react with  acetylene gas to form [CuCl(C2H2)], while an NH3 solution of CuCl forms an explosive  acetylide with  acetylene. Complexes of CuCl with  alkenes can be made by reduction of  CuCl2 by  sulfur dioxide in the presence of the  alkene in alcohol solution. Complexes with  chelating  alkenes such as  1,5-cyclooctadiene are particularly stable:CuCl reacts with organometallic compounds such as  methyllithium (CH3Li) to form "Gilman reagents" such as (CH3)2CuLi, which find extensive use in  organic synthesis.  Grignard reagents react similarly. Preparation
Copper(I) chloride may be prepared by the reduction of copper(II) salts such as  CuSO4 using  sulfur dioxide or copper metal.  SO2 may be prepared in situ from  sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) or  sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) and acid. The reduction is carried out in hydrochloric acid, and the resulting CuCl2- complex is diluted to precipitate white CuCl (by driving the  equilibrium using  Le Chatelier's principle).(1)  NaHSO3( aq) + HCl ( aq) →  SO2( aq) +  NaCl +  H2O( l)(2) 2  CuSO4( aq) +  SO2( aq) + 2  H2O( l) + 4 HCl( aq) → 2 HCuCl2( aq) + 3 H2SO4( aq)(3) HCuCl2( aq) +  H2O( l) → CuCl( s) +  H3O+( aq) + Cl-( aq) Uses
A major chemical use for copper(I) chloride is as a catalyst for a variety of organic reactions. Compared to other "soft" Lewis acids, it is much more affordable than non-toxic  silver(I) chloride and  palladium(II) chloride, and much less toxic than  lead(II) chloride and  mercury(II) chloride. In addition, it can undergo redox chemistry via copper(II) or copper(III) intermediates. This combination of properties make copper(I) salts invaluable reagents.One such application is in the  Sandmeyer reaction. Treatment of an  arenediazonium salt with CuCl leads to an aryl chloride, for example:The reaction has wide scope, and usually gives good yields.The observation that copper(I) halides catalyse 1,4-addition of  Grignard reagents to alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones led to the development of  organocuprate reagents that are widely used today in  organic synthesis :Although other copper(I) compounds such as copper(I) iodide are now more often used for this type of reaction, there are cases where copper(I) chloride is particularly effective:Here, Bu indicates an n- butyl group. Without CuCl, the  Grignard reagent alone gives a mixture of 1,2 and 1,4-addition products (i.e., the butyl adds at the closer to the C=O).Copper(I) chloride is also an intermediate formed from  copper(II) chloride in the  Wacker process. Precautions
Copper salts do have some toxicity and should be handled with care; wear gloves and goggles. Avoid bringing CuCl into contact with  alkynes.Template:  inorganic stylesheet1 Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper%28I%29_chloride"

 Preparation
Copper(I) chloride may be prepared by the reduction of copper(II) salts such as  CuSO4 using  sulfur dioxide or copper metal.  SO2 may be prepared in situ from  sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) or  sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) and acid. The reduction is carried out in hydrochloric acid, and the resulting CuCl2- complex is diluted to precipitate white CuCl (by driving the  equilibrium using  Le Chatelier's principle).(1)  NaHSO3( aq) + HCl ( aq) →  SO2( aq) +  NaCl +  H2O( l)(2) 2  CuSO4( aq) +  SO2( aq) + 2  H2O( l) + 4 HCl( aq) → 2 HCuCl2( aq) + 3 H2SO4( aq)(3) HCuCl2( aq) +  H2O( l) → CuCl( s) +  H3O+( aq) + Cl-( aq) Uses
A major chemical use for copper(I) chloride is as a catalyst for a variety of organic reactions. Compared to other "soft" Lewis acids, it is much more affordable than non-toxic  silver(I) chloride and  palladium(II) chloride, and much less toxic than  lead(II) chloride and  mercury(II) chloride. In addition, it can undergo redox chemistry via copper(II) or copper(III) intermediates. This combination of properties make copper(I) salts invaluable reagents.One such application is in the  Sandmeyer reaction. Treatment of an  arenediazonium salt with CuCl leads to an aryl chloride, for example:The reaction has wide scope, and usually gives good yields.The observation that copper(I) halides catalyse 1,4-addition of  Grignard reagents to alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones led to the development of  organocuprate reagents that are widely used today in  organic synthesis :Although other copper(I) compounds such as copper(I) iodide are now more often used for this type of reaction, there are cases where copper(I) chloride is particularly effective:Here, Bu indicates an n- butyl group. Without CuCl, the  Grignard reagent alone gives a mixture of 1,2 and 1,4-addition products (i.e., the butyl adds at the closer to the C=O).Copper(I) chloride is also an intermediate formed from  copper(II) chloride in the  Wacker process. Precautions
Copper salts do have some toxicity and should be handled with care; wear gloves and goggles. Avoid bringing CuCl into contact with  alkynes.Template:  inorganic stylesheet1 Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper%28I%29_chloride"
