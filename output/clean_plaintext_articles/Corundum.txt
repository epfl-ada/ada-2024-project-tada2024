Corundum (from Tamil kurundam) is a crystalline form of  aluminium oxide and one of the  rock-forming minerals. It is naturally clear, but can have different colors when impurities are present.  Transparent specimens are used as  gems, called  ruby if  red, while all other colors are called  sapphire. In addition to its hardness, corundum is unusual for its high  density of 4.02 g/cmÂ³ which is very high for a transparent mineral composed of the low  atomic mass elements aluminium and oxygen.Due to corundum's hardness (pure corundum is defined to have 9.0 Mohs), it is commonly used as an  abrasive in machining, from huge machines to  sandpaper. Some  emery is a mix of corundum and other substances, and the mix is less abrasive, with a lower average  Mohs hardness near 8.0.Corundum occurs as a mineral in mica  schist,  gneiss, and some  marbles in  metamorphic terranes. It also occurs in low silica  igneous  syenite and  nepheline syenite  intrusives. Other occurrences are as masses adjacent to  ultramafic intrusives, associated with  lamprophyre  dikes and as large crystals in  pegmatites. Because of its hardness and resistance to weathering, it commonly occurs as a detrital mineral in stream and beach sands.Corundum for abrasives is mined in Zimbabwe, Russia, and India. Historically it was mined from deposits associated with  dunites in  North Carolina and from a nepheline syenite in  Craigmont, Ontario.  Emery grade corundum is found on the Greek island of  Naxos and near  Peekskill, New York. Abrasive corundum is synthetically manufactured from  bauxite.Synthetic Corundum
Gem-quality synthetic corundum is usually produced by the flame-fusion method (also called  Verneuil process). This allows the production of large quantities of  sapphire,  rubies, and other corundum gems. It is also possible to grow gem-quality synthetic corundum by flux-growth and  hydrothermal synthesis. Because of the simplicity of the methods involved in corundum synthesis, large quantities of these crystals became available on the market causing a significant reduction of price in recent years. Apart from ornamental use, synthetic corundum is also used to produce mechanical parts (tubes, rods, bearings, and other machined parts),  watch crystals, and  lasers.
