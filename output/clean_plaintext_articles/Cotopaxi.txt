Cotopaxi is a volcano located about 50 km south of Quito, Ecuador. At 5,897 m it is the second highest in the country—the highest being the  Chimborazo. Cotopaxi is technically referred to as a  stratovolcano. It has a height ( topographic prominence) of more than 3,000 m when measured from its base, which has a width about 23 km. It has one of the only equatorial glaciers.Occasional claims that Cotopaxi is the highest active volcano in the world are known to be incorrect.  Llullaillaco volcano is considerably higher and is definitely in an active phase, having erupted as recently as  1877.  Ojos del Salado is higher still, and there are indications near its summit of recent activity, although its remoteness precludes a definitive statement as to whether it is currently active.

There have been more than 50 eruptions of Cotopaxi since  1738. Numerous valleys formed by powerful  lahars (mudflows) surround the volcano. This poses a high risk to the local population, their settlements and fields. The city  Latacunga has been completely destroyed at least twice in its history. Cotopaxi's most violent eruptions in historical times occurred in the years  1744,  1768, and  1877. In the  1877 eruption  pyroclastic flows descended all sides of the mountain, with lahars traveling more than 100 km into the Pacific Ocean and western Amazon basin. There was a major eruption in  1903 through  1904, and some minor activity in  1942.The volcano is the subject of 1855 and 1862 paintings by  Frederic Edwin Church.
