Darmstadtium ( IPA: /ˌdɑːmˈʃtatiəm/), formerly called ununnilium ( IPA: /ˌjuːnuːˈnɪliəm/, symbol Uun) or  eka-platinum, is a chemical element with the symbol Ds and  atomic number 110. It is one of the so-called  super-heavy atoms. This  synthetic element quickly decays: its  isotopes of mass 267 to 273 have half-lives measured in microseconds. Heavier isotopes, of mass 279 and 281, have been subsequently synthesized and are more stable, with half-lives of 180  milliseconds and 11.1  seconds, respectively.
 History
Ds was  first generated on  November 9,  1994 at the  Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in  Darmstadt, Germany by a team headed by Dr. Jorge Rigol. Only a few atoms of it were prepared by  nuclear fusion, involving bombarding a lead target with nickel:

The element was named after the place of its discovery,  Darmstadt (the GSI is located in Wixhausen, a northern portion of the city). The new name was given to it by the  IUPAC on  August 16,  2003. Trivia
Some suggested (for fun) the name policium for the new element, because 110 is the  emergency telephone number for the German police. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadtium"
