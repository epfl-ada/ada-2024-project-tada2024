Dundee United Football Club is a Scottish football club located in Dundee. Officially, United are  nicknamed The Terrors and the supporters known as The Arabs, though the latter term has been applied equally to the club in recent times by the sporting media. The Tangerines is another term used to describe the club.United currently play in the  Scottish Premier League and following the departure of  Craig Brewster on  October 29,  2006,  Craig Levein has been appointed as the new manager.  Eddie Thompson,  chairman since September 2002, is the majority shareholder of Dundee United, whilst the supporters - under the guise of ArabTRUST - own the second majority. In  2005-06, Tannadice attracted an average attendance of 8,197, the sixth-highest average in the SPL.In European competition, United are Scotland's third best-represented team, competing 22 seasons in Europe, in a total of 104 European matches (five more than  Aberdeen). During the club's many European competition runs in the late 20th century, English-based media sometimes incorrectly called the team  Dundee - the name of their city rivals. This still occasionally happens today.
 History
 Beginning
Inspired by the examples of  Hibernian in Edinburgh and Celtic in Glasgow, the Irish community in Dundee formed a new football club in 1909, following the demise of  Dundee Harp. Originally called Dundee Hibernian, the club took over Clepington Park (renamed  Tannadice Park) from Dundee Wanderers and played their inaugural game on  18 August  1909 against Hibernian, with the match ending in a 1-1 draw. The club was saved from going out of business in October 1923 by a group of Dundee businessmen. They decided to change the club's name to Dundee United in order to attract a wider appeal. The name Dundee City was considered but was protested by city rivals Dundee.For many years, the club languished in the lower reaches of the Scottish league, competing in the top division only four seasons, until the appointment of  Jerry Kerr as manager in 1959. Kerr ended the club's 28-year absence from the First Division in his first season in charge, winning promotion through finishing second in the Second Division. Some notable players from this period included forwards Dennis Gillespie and Jim Irvine, and defenders Doug Smith and  Ron Yeats (who went on to captain Liverpool in the 1960s).In the following season, United finished in the top half of the league (one place above city rivals Dundee), where the club would stay with few exceptions for the next 35 years. The sixties were highlighted by the playing skills of the some notable imports from Scandinavia:  Orjan Persson, Finn Seemann, Lennart Wing,  Finn Døssing and Mogens Berg. These players also helped give United their first taste of the European scene, where they sensationally eliminated  Barcelona in 1966, who were the then-holders of the  Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now known as the UEFA Cup). Jim McLean
 Jim McLean, who was a coach at city rivals Dundee F.C. at the time, took over from Jerry Kerr in 1971 and the most successful era in the club's history began. Up until this point, United was the smaller and less successful of the two Dundee-based football clubs. However, this would change as McLean (and for a time, with assistant manager  Walter Smith) took United to their first ever  Scottish Cup final in  1973-74. They achieved a record high of third place in the Scottish Premier Division in  1978 then again in  1979, before guiding the side to several major honours; the first by winning the  Scottish League Cup in  1979-80, with the trophy being retained the following season. McLean's use of youth was seen as key in the club's success for the next two decades.Dundee United's best season came in  1982-83 when they won the  Scottish Premier Division title for the first time in the club's history, with what was then a record number of points and record number of goals scored. By then, United had already established a reputation in Europe with impressive wins over sides like  AS Monaco,  Borussia Mönchengladbach,  PSV Eindhoven,  Anderlecht and  Werder Bremen.In the resulting  European Cup, United reached the semi-final stage in their first run, only to be narrowly eliminated by  A.S. Roma. After winning the first leg 2-0, United lost 3-0 away, although the Italian side were later fined for attempting to bribe the referee.The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

In European competition, United are Scotland's third best-represented team, competing 22 seasons in Europe, in a total of 104 European matches (five more than  Aberdeen). During the club's many European competition runs in the late 20th century, English-based media sometimes incorrectly called the team  Dundee - the name of their city rivals. This still occasionally happens today.
 History
 Beginning
Inspired by the examples of  Hibernian in Edinburgh and Celtic in Glasgow, the Irish community in Dundee formed a new football club in 1909, following the demise of  Dundee Harp. Originally called Dundee Hibernian, the club took over Clepington Park (renamed  Tannadice Park) from Dundee Wanderers and played their inaugural game on  18 August  1909 against Hibernian, with the match ending in a 1-1 draw. The club was saved from going out of business in October 1923 by a group of Dundee businessmen. They decided to change the club's name to Dundee United in order to attract a wider appeal. The name Dundee City was considered but was protested by city rivals Dundee.For many years, the club languished in the lower reaches of the Scottish league, competing in the top division only four seasons, until the appointment of  Jerry Kerr as manager in 1959. Kerr ended the club's 28-year absence from the First Division in his first season in charge, winning promotion through finishing second in the Second Division. Some notable players from this period included forwards Dennis Gillespie and Jim Irvine, and defenders Doug Smith and  Ron Yeats (who went on to captain Liverpool in the 1960s).In the following season, United finished in the top half of the league (one place above city rivals Dundee), where the club would stay with few exceptions for the next 35 years. The sixties were highlighted by the playing skills of the some notable imports from Scandinavia:  Orjan Persson, Finn Seemann, Lennart Wing,  Finn Døssing and Mogens Berg. These players also helped give United their first taste of the European scene, where they sensationally eliminated  Barcelona in 1966, who were the then-holders of the  Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now known as the UEFA Cup). Jim McLean
 Jim McLean, who was a coach at city rivals Dundee F.C. at the time, took over from Jerry Kerr in 1971 and the most successful era in the club's history began. Up until this point, United was the smaller and less successful of the two Dundee-based football clubs. However, this would change as McLean (and for a time, with assistant manager  Walter Smith) took United to their first ever  Scottish Cup final in  1973-74. They achieved a record high of third place in the Scottish Premier Division in  1978 then again in  1979, before guiding the side to several major honours; the first by winning the  Scottish League Cup in  1979-80, with the trophy being retained the following season. McLean's use of youth was seen as key in the club's success for the next two decades.Dundee United's best season came in  1982-83 when they won the  Scottish Premier Division title for the first time in the club's history, with what was then a record number of points and record number of goals scored. By then, United had already established a reputation in Europe with impressive wins over sides like  AS Monaco,  Borussia Mönchengladbach,  PSV Eindhoven,  Anderlecht and  Werder Bremen.In the resulting  European Cup, United reached the semi-final stage in their first run, only to be narrowly eliminated by  A.S. Roma. After winning the first leg 2-0, United lost 3-0 away, although the Italian side were later fined for attempting to bribe the referee.The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004.

These players also helped give United their first taste of the European scene, where they sensationally eliminated  Barcelona in 1966, who were the then-holders of the  Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now known as the UEFA Cup). Jim McLean
 Jim McLean, who was a coach at city rivals Dundee F.C. at the time, took over from Jerry Kerr in 1971 and the most successful era in the club's history began. Up until this point, United was the smaller and less successful of the two Dundee-based football clubs. However, this would change as McLean (and for a time, with assistant manager  Walter Smith) took United to their first ever  Scottish Cup final in  1973-74. They achieved a record high of third place in the Scottish Premier Division in  1978 then again in  1979, before guiding the side to several major honours; the first by winning the  Scottish League Cup in  1979-80, with the trophy being retained the following season. McLean's use of youth was seen as key in the club's success for the next two decades.Dundee United's best season came in  1982-83 when they won the  Scottish Premier Division title for the first time in the club's history, with what was then a record number of points and record number of goals scored. By then, United had already established a reputation in Europe with impressive wins over sides like  AS Monaco,  Borussia Mönchengladbach,  PSV Eindhoven,  Anderlecht and  Werder Bremen.In the resulting  European Cup, United reached the semi-final stage in their first run, only to be narrowly eliminated by  A.S. Roma. After winning the first leg 2-0, United lost 3-0 away, although the Italian side were later fined for attempting to bribe the referee.The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

 Beginning
Inspired by the examples of  Hibernian in Edinburgh and Celtic in Glasgow, the Irish community in Dundee formed a new football club in 1909, following the demise of  Dundee Harp. Originally called Dundee Hibernian, the club took over Clepington Park (renamed  Tannadice Park) from Dundee Wanderers and played their inaugural game on  18 August  1909 against Hibernian, with the match ending in a 1-1 draw. The club was saved from going out of business in October 1923 by a group of Dundee businessmen. They decided to change the club's name to Dundee United in order to attract a wider appeal. The name Dundee City was considered but was protested by city rivals Dundee.For many years, the club languished in the lower reaches of the Scottish league, competing in the top division only four seasons, until the appointment of  Jerry Kerr as manager in 1959. Kerr ended the club's 28-year absence from the First Division in his first season in charge, winning promotion through finishing second in the Second Division. Some notable players from this period included forwards Dennis Gillespie and Jim Irvine, and defenders Doug Smith and  Ron Yeats (who went on to captain Liverpool in the 1960s).In the following season, United finished in the top half of the league (one place above city rivals Dundee), where the club would stay with few exceptions for the next 35 years. The sixties were highlighted by the playing skills of the some notable imports from Scandinavia:  Orjan Persson, Finn Seemann, Lennart Wing,  Finn Døssing and Mogens Berg. These players also helped give United their first taste of the European scene, where they sensationally eliminated  Barcelona in 1966, who were the then-holders of the  Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now known as the UEFA Cup). Jim McLean
 Jim McLean, who was a coach at city rivals Dundee F.C. at the time, took over from Jerry Kerr in 1971 and the most successful era in the club's history began. Up until this point, United was the smaller and less successful of the two Dundee-based football clubs. However, this would change as McLean (and for a time, with assistant manager  Walter Smith) took United to their first ever  Scottish Cup final in  1973-74. They achieved a record high of third place in the Scottish Premier Division in  1978 then again in  1979, before guiding the side to several major honours; the first by winning the  Scottish League Cup in  1979-80, with the trophy being retained the following season.

Roma. After winning the first leg 2-0, United lost 3-0 away, although the Italian side were later fined for attempting to bribe the referee.The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs.

According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club.

In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

Inspired by the examples of  Hibernian in Edinburgh and Celtic in Glasgow, the Irish community in Dundee formed a new football club in 1909, following the demise of  Dundee Harp. Originally called Dundee Hibernian, the club took over Clepington Park (renamed  Tannadice Park) from Dundee Wanderers and played their inaugural game on  18 August  1909 against Hibernian, with the match ending in a 1-1 draw. The club was saved from going out of business in October 1923 by a group of Dundee businessmen. They decided to change the club's name to Dundee United in order to attract a wider appeal. The name Dundee City was considered but was protested by city rivals Dundee.For many years, the club languished in the lower reaches of the Scottish league, competing in the top division only four seasons, until the appointment of  Jerry Kerr as manager in 1959. Kerr ended the club's 28-year absence from the First Division in his first season in charge, winning promotion through finishing second in the Second Division. Some notable players from this period included forwards Dennis Gillespie and Jim Irvine, and defenders Doug Smith and  Ron Yeats (who went on to captain Liverpool in the 1960s).In the following season, United finished in the top half of the league (one place above city rivals Dundee), where the club would stay with few exceptions for the next 35 years. The sixties were highlighted by the playing skills of the some notable imports from Scandinavia:  Orjan Persson, Finn Seemann, Lennart Wing,  Finn Døssing and Mogens Berg. These players also helped give United their first taste of the European scene, where they sensationally eliminated  Barcelona in 1966, who were the then-holders of the  Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now known as the UEFA Cup). Jim McLean
 Jim McLean, who was a coach at city rivals Dundee F.C. at the time, took over from Jerry Kerr in 1971 and the most successful era in the club's history began. Up until this point, United was the smaller and less successful of the two Dundee-based football clubs. However, this would change as McLean (and for a time, with assistant manager  Walter Smith) took United to their first ever  Scottish Cup final in  1973-74. They achieved a record high of third place in the Scottish Premier Division in  1978 then again in  1979, before guiding the side to several major honours; the first by winning the  Scottish League Cup in  1979-80, with the trophy being retained the following season. McLean's use of youth was seen as key in the club's success for the next two decades.Dundee United's best season came in  1982-83 when they won the  Scottish Premier Division title for the first time in the club's history, with what was then a record number of points and record number of goals scored. By then, United had already established a reputation in Europe with impressive wins over sides like  AS Monaco,  Borussia Mönchengladbach,  PSV Eindhoven,  Anderlecht and  Werder Bremen.In the resulting  European Cup, United reached the semi-final stage in their first run, only to be narrowly eliminated by  A.S. Roma. After winning the first leg 2-0, United lost 3-0 away, although the Italian side were later fined for attempting to bribe the referee.The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

In the following season, United finished in the top half of the league (one place above city rivals Dundee), where the club would stay with few exceptions for the next 35 years. The sixties were highlighted by the playing skills of the some notable imports from Scandinavia:  Orjan Persson, Finn Seemann, Lennart Wing,  Finn Døssing and Mogens Berg. These players also helped give United their first taste of the European scene, where they sensationally eliminated  Barcelona in 1966, who were the then-holders of the  Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now known as the UEFA Cup). Jim McLean
 Jim McLean, who was a coach at city rivals Dundee F.C. at the time, took over from Jerry Kerr in 1971 and the most successful era in the club's history began. Up until this point, United was the smaller and less successful of the two Dundee-based football clubs. However, this would change as McLean (and for a time, with assistant manager  Walter Smith) took United to their first ever  Scottish Cup final in  1973-74. They achieved a record high of third place in the Scottish Premier Division in  1978 then again in  1979, before guiding the side to several major honours; the first by winning the  Scottish League Cup in  1979-80, with the trophy being retained the following season. McLean's use of youth was seen as key in the club's success for the next two decades.Dundee United's best season came in  1982-83 when they won the  Scottish Premier Division title for the first time in the club's history, with what was then a record number of points and record number of goals scored. By then, United had already established a reputation in Europe with impressive wins over sides like  AS Monaco,  Borussia Mönchengladbach,  PSV Eindhoven,  Anderlecht and  Werder Bremen.In the resulting  European Cup, United reached the semi-final stage in their first run, only to be narrowly eliminated by  A.S. Roma. After winning the first leg 2-0, United lost 3-0 away, although the Italian side were later fined for attempting to bribe the referee.The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second.

Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

 Jim McLean
 Jim McLean, who was a coach at city rivals Dundee F.C. at the time, took over from Jerry Kerr in 1971 and the most successful era in the club's history began. Up until this point, United was the smaller and less successful of the two Dundee-based football clubs. However, this would change as McLean (and for a time, with assistant manager  Walter Smith) took United to their first ever  Scottish Cup final in  1973-74. They achieved a record high of third place in the Scottish Premier Division in  1978 then again in  1979, before guiding the side to several major honours; the first by winning the  Scottish League Cup in  1979-80, with the trophy being retained the following season. McLean's use of youth was seen as key in the club's success for the next two decades.Dundee United's best season came in  1982-83 when they won the  Scottish Premier Division title for the first time in the club's history, with what was then a record number of points and record number of goals scored. By then, United had already established a reputation in Europe with impressive wins over sides like  AS Monaco,  Borussia Mönchengladbach,  PSV Eindhoven,  Anderlecht and  Werder Bremen.In the resulting  European Cup, United reached the semi-final stage in their first run, only to be narrowly eliminated by  A.S. Roma. After winning the first leg 2-0, United lost 3-0 away, although the Italian side were later fined for attempting to bribe the referee.The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

Dundee United's best season came in  1982-83 when they won the  Scottish Premier Division title for the first time in the club's history, with what was then a record number of points and record number of goals scored. By then, United had already established a reputation in Europe with impressive wins over sides like  AS Monaco,  Borussia Mönchengladbach,  PSV Eindhoven,  Anderlecht and  Werder Bremen.In the resulting  European Cup, United reached the semi-final stage in their first run, only to be narrowly eliminated by  A.S. Roma. After winning the first leg 2-0, United lost 3-0 away, although the Italian side were later fined for attempting to bribe the referee.The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

The pinnacle of their achievements in Europe came later in  1986-87 when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the  UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their earlier 1966 feat of again eliminating FC Barcelona then managed by  Terry Venables and featuring British players  Gary Lineker,  Mark Hughes and  Steve Archibald, with victories home and away. United are the only British side to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games.Although they failed to beat  IFK Göteborg in the two legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at  Tannadice Park.During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin.

It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin.

During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the  Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known as the  New Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm  derby had superseded the Dundee derby.Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. However, after nearly 22 years at the helm he relinquished the position in the June 1993, whilst remaining Chairman of the Club. After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium

Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

 After McLean

 Filling his shoes was the first continental to be appointed manager of a Scottish club -  Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell  Duncan Ferguson to  Rangers for a fee of £4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, United had already turned down £3million bids from  Bayern Munich,  Leeds United and Chelsea before accepting Rangers' record bid.In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours.

Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin.

 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

In Golac's first season, he brought the  Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1-0 with  Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range, sparking headlines of 'seventh heaven' in various newspapers.However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season  1994-95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1-0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the  First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second. This left them facing a two leg  playoff against  Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the  1996-97 season. Dundee United won 3-2 on aggregate, thus becoming the only club to be promoted through this short-lived play-off system.In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins.

Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

In recent years the club has struggled to maintain such success, much like the previous provincial powers of Scottish football. In  1997-98, United reached the  League Cup final, but lost 3-0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in  2004-05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1-0.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion.

United's playing kit is distinct:  tangerine in colour, first used when the team played under the  Dallas Tornado moniker in the  United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against  Everton in August.When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to distance themselves from their Irish origins. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops,  Queen's Park-style narrow hoops and an  Airdrie-style "V" motif.The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

The present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous  Lion Rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours. Previously, the lion (presumably adopted as a symbol of Scottish patriotism) had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this "classic" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge. Stadium



Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated just yards away from  Dens Park, home of Dundee F.C.; the two grounds are the closest senior football grounds in the United Kingdom. The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a  League Cup tie against  Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens.The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved.

There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin.

The possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium has been suggested on occasion. The most serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the  2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved. Supporters
There have been several stories regarding the origins of the 'Arabs' term. The most popular view is that the name was coined during the severe winter of the  1962-63 season. It was so bad that between December and March, Dundee United were able to play only three times.One of these was a  Scottish Cup tie against  Albion Rovers, for which the management, in a desperate attempt to get Tannadice playable, hired an industrial tar burner to melt the several inches of covering snow and ice. Not only did this work but removed the grass, too. Several lorry loads of sand were ordered and spread across the barren surface with the regulation playing lines painted on top. United adapted well to this playing surface and won the game 3-0, prompting observers to comment that they had taken to the new surface like  Arabs.Other sources point to earlier usage, with a "1950s sandtrap" used as one such reference.The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson

The fans, however, used the term to describe themselves. The term was then later resurrected during the early 1990s through the pages of the popular Dundee United football  fanzine, The Final Hurdle, with supporters soon declaring that they were 'Proud To Be An Arab'.  Deacon Blue singer and long-time Dundee United supporter  Ricky Ross even wrote a song declaring this fact. By then, even the official club souvenir shops were selling replica  keffiyehs in tangerine and black. The term was now firmly connected with Dundee United.The former Dundee United Supporters Association (DUSA) is now known as the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, whilst on 1st February 2003, the Dundee United Supporters Society - ArabTRUST - was officially launched, and after regular share purchase and investment into the Club, ArabTRUST not only hold the largest shareholding in the club behind the Thompson family, but were also granted an Associate Directorship in the Club in early 2004. The official club weekly email newsletter is known as ArabNeWS, and the club website has an ArabFORUM. Various supporters clubs and fan websites have 'Arab' in their names too.Elsewhere, the football media tend to refer to the club mostly as The Arabs, although the official website confirms this refers to the fans and the club nickname is The Terrors.In a BBC online  poll in March 2006, Dundee United fan  Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity by a landslide margin. Other famous Arabs include:
 George Galloway Geoffrey Hayes Billy Kay Lorraine Kelly Liz McColgan  Ricky Ross Lord Watson
