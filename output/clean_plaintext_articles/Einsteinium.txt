Einsteinium ( IPA: /ˌʌɪnˈstʌɪniəm/) is a  synthetic element in the periodic table that has the symbol Es and  atomic number 99. A metallic highly  radioactive  transuranic element (7th in the series) in the  actinides, einsteinium is produced by bombarding plutonium with neutrons and was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb test. It was named after Albert Einstein and has no known uses. Tracer studies using the  isotope 253Es show that einsteinium has chemical properties typical of a heavy trivalent, actinide element.
 History
Einsteinium was  first identified in December  1952 by  Albert Ghiorso at the  University of California, Berkeley and another team headed by  G.R. Choppin at  Los Alamos National Laboratory. Both were examining debris from the first hydrogen bomb test of November  1952 (see  Operation Ivy). They discovered the  isotope 253Es ( half-life 20.5 days) that was made by the  nuclear fusion of 15 neutrons with 238U (which then went through seven  beta decays). These findings were kept secret until  1955 due to Cold War tensions, however.In  1961, enough einsteinium was synthesized to prepare a macroscopic amount of 253Es. This sample weighed about 0.01 mg and was measured using a special balance. The material produced was used to produce mendelevium. Further einsteinium has been produced at the  Oak Ridge National Laboratory's  High Flux Isotope Reactor in  Tennessee by bombarding 239Pu with neutrons. Around 3 mg was created over a four year program of irradiation and then chemical separation from a starting 1 kg of plutonium isotope. Isotopes
19  radioisotopes of einsteinium have been characterized, with the most stable being 252Es with a  half-life of 471.7 days, 254Es with a half-life of 275.7 days, 255Es with a half-life of 39.8 days, and 253Es with a half-life of 20.47 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 40 hours, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 30 minutes. This element also has 3  meta states, with the most stable being 254mEs (t½ 39.3 hours). The isotopes of einsteinium range in  atomic mass from 240.069  u (240Es) to 258.100 u (258Es).
