Etymologically an emirate or amirate ( Arabic : إمارة translit: , plural: إمارات Imarat ) is the quality, dignity, office or territorial competence of any Emir (prince, governor etc.).
## As monarchies
Generally speaking, an emirate designates a political territory that is ruled by a dynastic Islamic Monarch styled emir (see that article). As most emirates have either disappeared, been integrated in a larger modern state or changed their rulers' styles, e.g. to Malik (Arabic for King) or Sultan , such true emirate-states have become rare.
An example of this use persists in the United Arab Emirates , a federal nation that comprises seven federal emirates, each administered by a hereditary emir, these seven forming the electoral college for the federation's President and PM.
## As provinces
Furthermore, in Arabic (usually styled Sheikh) of the royal family, as in Saudi Arabian governorates.
