Erbium ( IPA: /ˈɛː(r)biəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Er and  atomic number 68. A rare silvery metallic  lanthanide  rare earth element, erbium is associated with several other rare elements in the mineral  gadolinite from  Ytterby in Sweden.
 Notable characteristics
A  trivalent element, pure erbium metal is malleable (or easily shaped), soft yet stable in air and does not  oxidize as quickly as some other rare-earth metals. Its salts are rose-colored and the element gives a characteristic sharp  absorption spectra in  visible light, ultraviolet, and near  infrared. Otherwise it looks much like the other rare earths. Its  sesquioxide is called  erbia. Erbium's properties are to a degree dictated by the kind and amount of impurities present. Erbium does not play any known biological role but is thought by some to be able to stimulate  metabolism. Erbium doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media, where erbium ions are optically pumped at around 980nm or 1480nm and then radiate light at 1550nm. This process can be used to create  lasers and  optical amplifiers. The 1550nm wavelength is especially important for  optical communications becase standard single mode  optical fibers have minimal loss at this particular wavelength. Applications
Erbium's everyday uses are varied. It is commonly used as a  photographic filter and because of its resilience it is useful as a metallurgical additive. Other uses:
Used in  nuclear technology as a neutron absorber.Used as a  dopant in  fibre optic laser amplifiers.When added to vanadium as an  alloy erbium lowers hardness and improves workability. Erbium oxide has a pink colour and is sometimes used as a colorant for glass and  porcelain. The glass is then often used in  sunglasses and cheap  jewelry.Erbium doped  optical silica-glass fibers is the active element in  erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) which are widely used in  optical communications. The same fibers can be used to create fibre  lasers. Co-doping of optical fiber with Er and Yb is used in high power Er/Yb fibre lasers, which gradually replace CO2 lasers for metal welding and cutting applications. Erbium can also be used in  erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers.
 History
Erbium (for  Ytterby, a town in Sweden) was  discovered by  Carl Gustaf Mosander in  1843. Mosander separated "yttria" from the mineral  gadolinite into three fractions which he called  yttria,  erbia, and  terbia. He named the new element after the town of Ytterby where large concentrations of yttria and erbium are located. Erbia and terbia, however, were confused at this time. After  1860, terbia was renamed erbia and after  1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia. Fairly pure Er2O3 was independently isolated in  1905 by  Georges Urbain and  Charles James. Reasonably pure metal wasn't produced until  1934 when workers reduced the  anhydrous  chloride with potassium vapor. Occurrence
Like other rare earths, this element is never found as a free element in nature but is found bound in  monazite sand ores. It has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but  ion-exchange production techniques developed in the late 20th century have greatly brought down the cost of production of all rare-earth metals and their  chemical compounds. The principal commercial sources of erbium are from the minerals  xenotime and  euxenite. Metallic erbium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard. Isotopes
Naturally occurring erbium is composed of 6 stable  isotopes, Er-162, Er-164, Er-166, Er-167, Er-168, and Er-170 with Er-166 being the most abundant (33.6%  natural abundance). 23  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being Er-169 with a  half life of 9.4 days, Er-172 with a half-life of 49.3 hours, Er-160 with a half-life of 28.58 hours, Er-165 with a half-life of 10.36 hours, and Er-171 with a half life of 7.516 hours. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 3.5 hours, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 4 minutes. This element also has 6  meta states, with the most stable being Er-167m (t½ 2.269 seconds).The isotopes of erbium range in  atomic weight from 144.957  amu (Er-145) to 173.944 amu (Er-174). The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, Er-166, is  electron capture, and the primary mode after is  beta decay. The primary  decay products before Er-166 are element 67 (holmium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 69 (thulium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, erbium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbium"

The primary  decay products before Er-166 are element 67 (holmium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 69 (thulium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, erbium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbium"




 Isotopes
Naturally occurring erbium is composed of 6 stable  isotopes, Er-162, Er-164, Er-166, Er-167, Er-168, and Er-170 with Er-166 being the most abundant (33.6%  natural abundance). 23  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being Er-169 with a  half life of 9.4 days, Er-172 with a half-life of 49.3 hours, Er-160 with a half-life of 28.58 hours, Er-165 with a half-life of 10.36 hours, and Er-171 with a half life of 7.516 hours. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 3.5 hours, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 4 minutes.
