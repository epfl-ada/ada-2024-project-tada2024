Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson  OM PC  FRS ( 30 August  1871 –  19 October  1937), was a nuclear  physicist from New Zealand. He was known as the "father" of  nuclear physics, he pioneered the  orbital theory of the atom, in his discovery of  Rutherford scattering off the  nucleus with the  gold foil experiment.
 Early years
Rutherford was born at Spring Grove, (now in  Brightwater), near  Nelson, New Zealand. He studied at  Nelson College and won a  scholarship to study at  Canterbury College,  University of New Zealand. In  1895, after gaining his BA, MA and BSc, and doing two years of research at the forefront of electrical technology, Rutherford travelled to England for postgraduate study at the  Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge (1895- 1898), and was resident at Trinity College. There, he briefly held the world record for the distance over which electromagnetic waves could be detected. During the investigation of  radioactivity he coined the terms  alpha,  beta, and  gamma rays. Middle years
In  1898 Rutherford was appointed to the chair of physics at  McGill University, in the country of Canada, where he did the work which gained him the  1908  Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He had demonstrated that radioactivity was the spontaneous disintegration of atoms. He noticed that in a sample of radioactive material it invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay — its " half-life" — and created a practical application for this phenomenon using this constant rate of decay as a clock, which could then be used to help determine the actual age of the Earth that turned out to be much older than most scientists at the time believed.In  1907 he took the chair of physics at the  University of Manchester. There he directed the  Geiger-Marsden experiment that discovered the nuclear nature of atoms and was the world's first successful "alchemist": he converted nitrogen into oxygen. While working with Niels Bohr (who discovered that electrons moved in specific orbits) Rutherford theorized about the existence of neutrons, which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of protons by causing an attractive nuclear force and thus keeping the nuclei from breaking apart. Later years

He was  knighted in  1914. In  1917 he returned to the Cavendish as Director. Under him, Nobel Prizes were awarded to  Chadwick for discovering the neutron (in  1932),  Cockcroft and  Walton for splitting the atom using a  particle accelerator and  Appleton for demonstrating the existence of the  ionosphere. He was admitted to the  Order of Merit in  1925 and in  1931 was created Baron Rutherford of Nelson of Cambridge in the County of Cambridge, a title which became extinct upon his death. Impact and legacy


 Rutherford was known as the "crocodile". Engraving by  Eric Gill at the original Cavendish site in Cambridge.


His research, along with that of his protege,  Sir Mark Oliphant was instrumental in the convening of the  Manhattan Project. He is famously quoted as saying: "In science there is only physics; all the rest is  stamp collecting." He is also reputed to have stated that the idea of using nuclear reaction to generate useful power was "moonshine".Things named after Rutherford include:
