Europium ( IPA: /jʊˈrəʊpiəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Eu and  atomic number 63. It was named after the continent Europe.
 Notable characteristics
Europium is the most reactive of the  rare earth elements; it instantly oxidizes in air, and resembles calcium in its reaction with water; deliveries of the metal element in solid form even under mineral oil are rarely shiny. Europium ignites in air at about 150 °C to 180 °C. It is about as hard as lead and quite ductile. Applications
There are few commercial applications for europium metal, although it has been used to dope some types of glass to make  lasers, as well as being used for screening for Down syndrome and some other genetic diseases. Due to its ability to absorb neutrons, it is also being studied for use in nuclear reactors. Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red  phosphor in  television sets and  fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. It is also being used as an agent for the manufacture of fluorescent glass. Europium fluorescence is used to interogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens. It is also used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in Euro banknotes. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in  geochemistry and  petrology to understand the processes that form  igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or  lava). The nature of the  europium anomaly found is used to help reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks. History
Europium was first found by  Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in  1890, who obtained basic fraction from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or gadolinium; however, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French  chemist  Eugène-Antole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in  1896 and who was able to isolate europium in  1901. Occurrence
Europium is never found in nature as the free element; however, there are many minerals containing europium, with the most important sources being  bastnasite and  monazite. Europium has also been identified in the spectra of the sun and certain stars. Compounds

Europium(II) compounds tend to predominate, which is a slight exception as most  lanthanides form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. Europium(II) chemistry is very similar to barium(II) chemistry, as they have similar  ionic radii. See also  europium compounds. Isotopes
Naturally occurring europium is composed of 2 stable  isotopes, 151-Eu and 153-Eu, with 153-Eu being the most abundant (52.2%  natural abundance). 35  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being 150-Eu with a  half-life of 36.9 years, 152-Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, and 154-Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 4.7612 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 12.2 seconds. This element also has 8  meta states, with the most stable being 150m-Eu (t½ 12.8 hours), 152m1-Eu (t½ 9.3116 hours) and 152m2-Eu (t½ 96 minutes).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 153-Eu, is  electron capture, and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 153-Eu are element Sm (samarium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Gd (gadolinium) isotopes. Precautions
The toxicity of europium compounds has not been fully investigated, but there are no clear indications that europium is highly toxic compared to other heavy metals. The metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard. Europium has no known biological role. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europium"

 EuN

Europium(II) compounds tend to predominate, which is a slight exception as most  lanthanides form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. Europium(II) chemistry is very similar to barium(II) chemistry, as they have similar  ionic radii. See also  europium compounds. Isotopes
Naturally occurring europium is composed of 2 stable  isotopes, 151-Eu and 153-Eu, with 153-Eu being the most abundant (52.2%  natural abundance). 35  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being 150-Eu with a  half-life of 36.9 years, 152-Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, and 154-Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 4.7612 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 12.2 seconds. This element also has 8  meta states, with the most stable being 150m-Eu (t½ 12.8 hours), 152m1-Eu (t½ 9.3116 hours) and 152m2-Eu (t½ 96 minutes).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 153-Eu, is  electron capture, and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 153-Eu are element Sm (samarium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Gd (gadolinium) isotopes. Precautions
The toxicity of europium compounds has not been fully investigated, but there are no clear indications that europium is highly toxic compared to other heavy metals. The metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard. Europium has no known biological role. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europium"
