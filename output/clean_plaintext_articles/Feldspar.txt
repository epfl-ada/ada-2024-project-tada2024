Feldspar is the name of a group of rock-forming minerals which make up as much as 60% of the Earth's crust.Feldspars crystallize from magma in both  intrusive and  extrusive rocks, and they can also occur as compact minerals, as veins, and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock. Rock formed entirely of  plagioclase feldspar (see below) is known as  anorthosite. Feldspars are also found in many types of  sedimentary rock.
Etymology
Feldspar is derived from the German Feld, field, and Spat, a  rock that does not contain  ore. "Feldspathic" refers to materials that contain feldspar. The alternative spelling, felspar, has now largely fallen out of use.Compositions
This group of minerals consists of framework or  tectosilicates. Compositions of major elements in common feldspars can be expressed in terms of three  endmembers:K-feldspar endmember KAlSi3O8Albite endmember NaAlSi3O8Anorthite endmember CaAl2Si2O8 Solid solutions between K-feldspar and albite are called alkali feldspar. Solid solutions between albite and anorthite are called  plagioclase. Only limited solid solution occurs between K-feldspar and anorthite, and in the two other solid solutions, immiscibility occurs at temperatures common in the crust of the earth. Sanidine ( monoclinic),  orthoclase, and microcline ( triclinic) refer to  polymorphs of K-feldspar. Sanidine is stable at the highest temperatures, and microcline at the lowest.  Perthite is a typical texture in alkali feldspar, due to  exsolution of contrasting alkali feldspar compositions during cooling of an intermediate composition. The  perthitic textures in the alkali feldspars of many granites are coarse enough to be visible to the naked eye.Compositions of the plagioclase series have been labeled as follows (percent anorthite in parentheses):


 albite (0 to 10) oligoclase (10 to 30) andesine (30 to 50) labradorite (50 to 70) bytownite (70 to 90) anorthite (90 to 100)

Intermediate compositions of plagioclase feldspar also may exsolve to two feldspars of contrasting composition during cooling, but diffusion is much slower than in alkali feldspar, and the resulting two-feldspar intergrowths typically are too fine-grained to be visible with optical microscopes. The immiscibility gaps in the plagioclase  solid solution are complex compared to the gap in the alkali feldspars. The play of colors visible in some feldspar of labradorite composition is due to very fine-grained exsolution lamellae ( see image).Uses

Feldspar is a common raw material in the production of  ceramics.Feldspars are used for  thermoluminescence dating and  optical dating in earth sciences and archaeologyFeldspar is an ingredient in  Bon Ami brand household cleaner.
