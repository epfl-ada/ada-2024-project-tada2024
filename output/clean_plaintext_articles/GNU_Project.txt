The GNU Project was announced in 1983 by Richard Stallman. It initiated the GNU  operating system, software development for which began in January 1984.The founding goal of the project was, in the words of its initial announcement, to develop "a sufficient body of  free software [...] to get along without any software that is not free." That goal was achieved in  1992 when the last gap in the GNU system, a  kernel, was filled by a third-party Unix-style  kernel called "Linux" being released as free software.
