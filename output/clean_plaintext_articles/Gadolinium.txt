Gadolinium ( IPA: /ˌgadəˈlɪniəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Gd and  atomic number 64.



 Gadolinium >99.9% purity




 Notable characteristics
Gadolinium is a silvery white, malleable and ductile  rare earth metal with a metallic luster. It crystallizes in  hexagonal, close-packed alpha form at room temperature; when heated to 1508  K, it transforms into its beta form, which has a  body-centered cubic structure.Unlike other rare earth elements, gadolinium is relatively stable in dry air; however, it tarnishes quickly in moist air and forms a loosely adhering  oxide that spalls off and exposes more surface to oxidation. Gadolinium reacts slowly with water and is soluble in dilute acid.Gadolinium has the highest  thermal neutron  capture cross-section of any (known) element, 49,000  barns, but it also has a fast burn-out rate, limiting its usefulness as a  nuclear control rod material.Gadolinium becomes superconductive below a critical temperature of 1.083 K. It is strongly magnetic at room temperature, and exhibits  ferromagnetic properties below room temperature. Applications
Gadolinium is used for making  gadolinium yttrium garnets, which have  microwave applications, and gadolinium compounds are used for making phosphors for colour TV tubes. Gadolinium is also used for manufacturing compact discs and  computer memory.Gadolinium is used in  nuclear marine propulsion systems as a  burnable poison. The gadolinium slows the initial reaction rate, but as it decays other neutron poisons accumulate, allowing for long-running cores. Gadolinium is also used as a secondary, emergency shut-down measure in some nuclear reactors, particularly of the  CANDU type.Gadolinium also possesses unusual metallurgic properties, with as little as 1% of gadolinium improving the workability and resistance of iron, chromium and related  alloys to high temperatures and  oxidation.Because of their  paramagnetic properties, solutions of  organic gadolinium  complexes and gadolinium compounds are used as  intravenous  radiocontrast agents to enhance images in medical  magnetic resonance imaging.Beside  MRI, Gadolinium (Gd) is also used in other imaging. In  X-ray, gadolinium is containing in the phosphor layer suspending in a polymer matrix at the detector. Terbium-doped gadolinium oxysulfide (Gd2O2S: Tb) at the phosphor layer is to convert the X-rays releasing from the source into light. Gd can emit  spectrum at 540nm (Green light spectrum = 520 – 570nm), which is very useful for enhancing the imaging quality of the  X-ray that are exposed to the photographic film. Beside Gd’s spectrum range, the compound also has a K-edge at 50 kiloelectron volt (keV), which means its absorption of  X-ray through  photoelectric interactions is great. The energy conversion of Gd is up to 20%, which means, one-fifth of the X-ray striking on the phosphor layer can be converted into light photons. Gadolinium oxyorthosilicate (GSO) is a single crystal that is used as a  scintillator in medical imaging equipment like as  Positron Emission Tomography ( PET). Another new scintillator for detecting neutron is gadolinium orthosilicate (GSO - Gd2SiO5: Ce).
 Gallium Gadolinium Garnet (Gd3Ga5O12) is a material with good optical properties, and is used in fabrication of various optical components and as substrate material for magneto–optical films.In the future,  gadolinium ethyl sulfate, which has extremely low noise characteristics, may be used in  masers. Furthermore, gadolinium's high magnetic movement and low  Curie temperature (which lies just at room temperature) suggest applications as a magnetic component for sensing hot and cold.Due the extremely high neutron cross-section of Gadolinium, this element is very effective for use with neutron radiography. History
In  1880, Swiss  chemist  Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac observed spectroscopic lines due to gadolinium in samples of  didymium and  gadolinite; French chemist  Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran separated  gadolinia, the  oxide of Gadolinium, from Mosander's  yttria in  1886. The element itself was isolated only recently.Gadolinium, like the mineral  gadolinite, is named after Finnish chemist and  geologist  Johan Gadolin.In older literature the natural form of the element is often called an "earth", meaning that element came from the Earth. Accordingly - Gadolinium is the element that comes from the earth, gadolinia. Earths are compounds of the element and one or more other element. Two common combining elements are oxygen and sulfur. For example, gadolinia contains gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3). Biological role
Gadolinium has no known biological role. It is used as a component of MRI contrast agents as in the 3+ oxidation state the metal has 7 unpaired f electrons. This causes water around the contrast agent to relax quickly enhancing the quality of the MRI scan. Occurrence
Gadolinium is never found in nature as the free element, but is contained in many rare minerals such as  monazite and  bastnäsite. It occurs only in trace amounts in the mineral  gadolinite which was also named for  Johan Gadolin. Today, it is prepared by  ion exchange and  solvent extraction technique, or by the reduction of its anhydrous fluoride with metallic calcium. Compounds
Compounds of gadolinium include:
 Fluorides
 GdF3
 Chlorides
 GdCl3
 Bromides
 GdBr3
 Iodides
 GdI3
 Oxides
 Gd2O3
 Sulfides
 Gd2S3
 Nitrides

 Isotopes



Naturally occurring gadolinium is composed of 5 stable  isotopes, 154Gd, 155Gd, 156Gd, 157Gd and 158Gd, and 2  radioisotopes, 152Gd and 160Gd, with 158Gd being the most abundant (24.84%  natural abundance). 30  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 160Gd with a  half-life of more than 1.3×1021 years (the decay is not observed, only the lower limit on the half-life is known), alpha-decaying 152Gd with a half-life of 1.08×1014 years, and 150Gd with a half-life of 1.79×106 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 74.7 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 24.6 seconds. This element also has 4  meta states with the most stable being 143mGd (t½ 110 seconds), 145mGd (t½ 85 seconds) and 141mGd (t½ 24.5 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 158Gd, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 158Gd are element Eu (Europium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Tb (Terbium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, gadolinium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Also, in patients on dialysis, there are data suggesting that it may cause Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis, formerly known as Nephrogenic Dermopathy. See: Grobner T.

Furthermore, gadolinium's high magnetic movement and low  Curie temperature (which lies just at room temperature) suggest applications as a magnetic component for sensing hot and cold.Due the extremely high neutron cross-section of Gadolinium, this element is very effective for use with neutron radiography. History
In  1880, Swiss  chemist  Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac observed spectroscopic lines due to gadolinium in samples of  didymium and  gadolinite; French chemist  Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran separated  gadolinia, the  oxide of Gadolinium, from Mosander's  yttria in  1886. The element itself was isolated only recently.Gadolinium, like the mineral  gadolinite, is named after Finnish chemist and  geologist  Johan Gadolin.In older literature the natural form of the element is often called an "earth", meaning that element came from the Earth. Accordingly - Gadolinium is the element that comes from the earth, gadolinia. Earths are compounds of the element and one or more other element. Two common combining elements are oxygen and sulfur. For example, gadolinia contains gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3). Biological role
Gadolinium has no known biological role. It is used as a component of MRI contrast agents as in the 3+ oxidation state the metal has 7 unpaired f electrons. This causes water around the contrast agent to relax quickly enhancing the quality of the MRI scan. Occurrence
Gadolinium is never found in nature as the free element, but is contained in many rare minerals such as  monazite and  bastnäsite. It occurs only in trace amounts in the mineral  gadolinite which was also named for  Johan Gadolin. Today, it is prepared by  ion exchange and  solvent extraction technique, or by the reduction of its anhydrous fluoride with metallic calcium. Compounds
Compounds of gadolinium include:
 Fluorides
 GdF3

 Isotopes



Naturally occurring gadolinium is composed of 5 stable  isotopes, 154Gd, 155Gd, 156Gd, 157Gd and 158Gd, and 2  radioisotopes, 152Gd and 160Gd, with 158Gd being the most abundant (24.84%  natural abundance). 30  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 160Gd with a  half-life of more than 1.3×1021 years (the decay is not observed, only the lower limit on the half-life is known), alpha-decaying 152Gd with a half-life of 1.08×1014 years, and 150Gd with a half-life of 1.79×106 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 74.7 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 24.6 seconds. This element also has 4  meta states with the most stable being 143mGd (t½ 110 seconds), 145mGd (t½ 85 seconds) and 141mGd (t½ 24.5 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 158Gd, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 158Gd are element Eu (Europium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Tb (Terbium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, gadolinium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Also, in patients on dialysis, there are data suggesting that it may cause Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis, formerly known as Nephrogenic Dermopathy. See: Grobner T.

Unlike other rare earth elements, gadolinium is relatively stable in dry air; however, it tarnishes quickly in moist air and forms a loosely adhering  oxide that spalls off and exposes more surface to oxidation. Gadolinium reacts slowly with water and is soluble in dilute acid.Gadolinium has the highest  thermal neutron  capture cross-section of any (known) element, 49,000  barns, but it also has a fast burn-out rate, limiting its usefulness as a  nuclear control rod material.Gadolinium becomes superconductive below a critical temperature of 1.083 K. It is strongly magnetic at room temperature, and exhibits  ferromagnetic properties below room temperature. Applications
Gadolinium is used for making  gadolinium yttrium garnets, which have  microwave applications, and gadolinium compounds are used for making phosphors for colour TV tubes. Gadolinium is also used for manufacturing compact discs and  computer memory.Gadolinium is used in  nuclear marine propulsion systems as a  burnable poison. The gadolinium slows the initial reaction rate, but as it decays other neutron poisons accumulate, allowing for long-running cores. Gadolinium is also used as a secondary, emergency shut-down measure in some nuclear reactors, particularly of the  CANDU type.Gadolinium also possesses unusual metallurgic properties, with as little as 1% of gadolinium improving the workability and resistance of iron, chromium and related  alloys to high temperatures and  oxidation.Because of their  paramagnetic properties, solutions of  organic gadolinium  complexes and gadolinium compounds are used as  intravenous  radiocontrast agents to enhance images in medical  magnetic resonance imaging.Beside  MRI, Gadolinium (Gd) is also used in other imaging. In  X-ray, gadolinium is containing in the phosphor layer suspending in a polymer matrix at the detector. Terbium-doped gadolinium oxysulfide (Gd2O2S: Tb) at the phosphor layer is to convert the X-rays releasing from the source into light. Gd can emit  spectrum at 540nm (Green light spectrum = 520 – 570nm), which is very useful for enhancing the imaging quality of the  X-ray that are exposed to the photographic film. Beside Gd’s spectrum range, the compound also has a K-edge at 50 kiloelectron volt (keV), which means its absorption of  X-ray through  photoelectric interactions is great. The energy conversion of Gd is up to 20%, which means, one-fifth of the X-ray striking on the phosphor layer can be converted into light photons. Gadolinium oxyorthosilicate (GSO) is a single crystal that is used as a  scintillator in medical imaging equipment like as  Positron Emission Tomography ( PET).

Beside Gd’s spectrum range, the compound also has a K-edge at 50 kiloelectron volt (keV), which means its absorption of  X-ray through  photoelectric interactions is great. The energy conversion of Gd is up to 20%, which means, one-fifth of the X-ray striking on the phosphor layer can be converted into light photons. Gadolinium oxyorthosilicate (GSO) is a single crystal that is used as a  scintillator in medical imaging equipment like as  Positron Emission Tomography ( PET). Another new scintillator for detecting neutron is gadolinium orthosilicate (GSO - Gd2SiO5: Ce).
 Gallium Gadolinium Garnet (Gd3Ga5O12) is a material with good optical properties, and is used in fabrication of various optical components and as substrate material for magneto–optical films.In the future,  gadolinium ethyl sulfate, which has extremely low noise characteristics, may be used in  masers. Furthermore, gadolinium's high magnetic movement and low  Curie temperature (which lies just at room temperature) suggest applications as a magnetic component for sensing hot and cold.Due the extremely high neutron cross-section of Gadolinium, this element is very effective for use with neutron radiography. History
In  1880, Swiss  chemist  Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac observed spectroscopic lines due to gadolinium in samples of  didymium and  gadolinite; French chemist  Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran separated  gadolinia, the  oxide of Gadolinium, from Mosander's  yttria in  1886. The element itself was isolated only recently.Gadolinium, like the mineral  gadolinite, is named after Finnish chemist and  geologist  Johan Gadolin.In older literature the natural form of the element is often called an "earth", meaning that element came from the Earth. Accordingly - Gadolinium is the element that comes from the earth, gadolinia. Earths are compounds of the element and one or more other element. Two common combining elements are oxygen and sulfur. For example, gadolinia contains gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3). Biological role
Gadolinium has no known biological role. It is used as a component of MRI contrast agents as in the 3+ oxidation state the metal has 7 unpaired f electrons. This causes water around the contrast agent to relax quickly enhancing the quality of the MRI scan. Occurrence
Gadolinium is never found in nature as the free element, but is contained in many rare minerals such as  monazite and  bastnäsite. It occurs only in trace amounts in the mineral  gadolinite which was also named for  Johan Gadolin. Today, it is prepared by  ion exchange and  solvent extraction technique, or by the reduction of its anhydrous fluoride with metallic calcium. Compounds

 Isotopes



Naturally occurring gadolinium is composed of 5 stable  isotopes, 154Gd, 155Gd, 156Gd, 157Gd and 158Gd, and 2  radioisotopes, 152Gd and 160Gd, with 158Gd being the most abundant (24.84%  natural abundance). 30  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 160Gd with a  half-life of more than 1.3×1021 years (the decay is not observed, only the lower limit on the half-life is known), alpha-decaying 152Gd with a half-life of 1.08×1014 years, and 150Gd with a half-life of 1.79×106 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 74.7 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 24.6 seconds. This element also has 4  meta states with the most stable being 143mGd (t½ 110 seconds), 145mGd (t½ 85 seconds) and 141mGd (t½ 24.5 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 158Gd, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 158Gd are element Eu (Europium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Tb (Terbium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, gadolinium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Also, in patients on dialysis, there are data suggesting that it may cause Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis, formerly known as Nephrogenic Dermopathy. See: Grobner T.

Gadolinium is used in  nuclear marine propulsion systems as a  burnable poison. The gadolinium slows the initial reaction rate, but as it decays other neutron poisons accumulate, allowing for long-running cores. Gadolinium is also used as a secondary, emergency shut-down measure in some nuclear reactors, particularly of the  CANDU type.Gadolinium also possesses unusual metallurgic properties, with as little as 1% of gadolinium improving the workability and resistance of iron, chromium and related  alloys to high temperatures and  oxidation.Because of their  paramagnetic properties, solutions of  organic gadolinium  complexes and gadolinium compounds are used as  intravenous  radiocontrast agents to enhance images in medical  magnetic resonance imaging.Beside  MRI, Gadolinium (Gd) is also used in other imaging. In  X-ray, gadolinium is containing in the phosphor layer suspending in a polymer matrix at the detector.

In the future,  gadolinium ethyl sulfate, which has extremely low noise characteristics, may be used in  masers. Furthermore, gadolinium's high magnetic movement and low  Curie temperature (which lies just at room temperature) suggest applications as a magnetic component for sensing hot and cold.Due the extremely high neutron cross-section of Gadolinium, this element is very effective for use with neutron radiography. History
In  1880, Swiss  chemist  Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac observed spectroscopic lines due to gadolinium in samples of  didymium and  gadolinite; French chemist  Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran separated  gadolinia, the  oxide of Gadolinium, from Mosander's  yttria in  1886. The element itself was isolated only recently.Gadolinium, like the mineral  gadolinite, is named after Finnish chemist and  geologist  Johan Gadolin.In older literature the natural form of the element is often called an "earth", meaning that element came from the Earth. Accordingly - Gadolinium is the element that comes from the earth, gadolinia. Earths are compounds of the element and one or more other element. Two common combining elements are oxygen and sulfur. For example, gadolinia contains gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3). Biological role
Gadolinium has no known biological role. It is used as a component of MRI contrast agents as in the 3+ oxidation state the metal has 7 unpaired f electrons. This causes water around the contrast agent to relax quickly enhancing the quality of the MRI scan. Occurrence
Gadolinium is never found in nature as the free element, but is contained in many rare minerals such as  monazite and  bastnäsite. It occurs only in trace amounts in the mineral  gadolinite which was also named for  Johan Gadolin. Today, it is prepared by  ion exchange and  solvent extraction technique, or by the reduction of its anhydrous fluoride with metallic calcium. Compounds
Compounds of gadolinium include:
 Fluorides
 GdF3
 Chlorides
 GdCl3
 Bromides
 GdBr3
 Iodides
 GdI3
 Oxides
 Gd2O3
 Sulfides

 Isotopes



Naturally occurring gadolinium is composed of 5 stable  isotopes, 154Gd, 155Gd, 156Gd, 157Gd and 158Gd, and 2  radioisotopes, 152Gd and 160Gd, with 158Gd being the most abundant (24.84%  natural abundance). 30  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 160Gd with a  half-life of more than 1.3×1021 years (the decay is not observed, only the lower limit on the half-life is known), alpha-decaying 152Gd with a half-life of 1.08×1014 years, and 150Gd with a half-life of 1.79×106 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 74.7 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 24.6 seconds. This element also has 4  meta states with the most stable being 143mGd (t½ 110 seconds), 145mGd (t½ 85 seconds) and 141mGd (t½ 24.5 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 158Gd, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 158Gd are element Eu (Europium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Tb (Terbium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, gadolinium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Also, in patients on dialysis, there are data suggesting that it may cause Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis, formerly known as Nephrogenic Dermopathy. See: Grobner T.

Naturally occurring gadolinium is composed of 5 stable  isotopes, 154Gd, 155Gd, 156Gd, 157Gd and 158Gd, and 2  radioisotopes, 152Gd and 160Gd, with 158Gd being the most abundant (24.84%  natural abundance). 30  radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 160Gd with a  half-life of more than 1.3×1021 years (the decay is not observed, only the lower limit on the half-life is known), alpha-decaying 152Gd with a half-life of 1.08×1014 years, and 150Gd with a half-life of 1.79×106 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 74.7 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 24.6 seconds. This element also has 4  meta states with the most stable being 143mGd (t½ 110 seconds), 145mGd (t½ 85 seconds) and 141mGd (t½ 24.5 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 158Gd, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 158Gd are element Eu (Europium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Tb (Terbium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, gadolinium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Also, in patients on dialysis, there are data suggesting that it may cause Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis, formerly known as Nephrogenic Dermopathy. See: Grobner T.
