Gallium ( IPA: /ˈgaliəm/) is a chemical element that has the symbol Ga and  atomic number 31. A rare, soft silvery metallic  poor metal, gallium is a brittle solid at low temperatures but liquefies slightly above room temperature and will melt in the hand. It occurs in trace amounts in  bauxite and zinc ores. An important application is in the compound  gallium arsenide, used as a semiconductor, most notably in  light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
 Notable characteristics
Elemental gallium is not found in nature, but it is easily obtained by  smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a brilliant silvery colour and its solid metal fractures  conchoidally like glass. Gallium metal expands by 3.1 percent when it solidifies, and therefore storage in either glass or metal containers is avoided, due to the possibility of container rupture with freezing. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with only a few materials like water and bismuth.Gallium also  attacks most other metals by  diffusing into their metal  lattice — another reason why it is important to keep gallium away from metal containers such as steel or aluminium. Gallium metal easily alloys with many metals, and was used in small quantities in the core of the first atomic bomb to help stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.The  melting point temperature of 30 °C allows the metal to be melted in the hand. This metal has a strong tendency to  supercool below its  melting point, thus necessitating  seeding in order to solidify. Gallium is one of the metals (with caesium, francium and mercury) which are liquid at or near normal room temperature, and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature  thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and (unlike mercury) for having a low  vapor pressure at high temperatures. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, making it mechanically more difficult to handle (even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions). For this reason as well as the metal contamination problem and freezing-expansion problems noted above, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.Gallium does not crystallize in any of the simple  crystal structures. The stable phase under normal conditions is  orthorhombic with 8 atoms in the conventional  unit cell. Each atom has only one nearest neighbour (at a distance of 244  pm) and six other neighbors within additional 39 pm. Many stable and  metastable phases are found as function of temperature and pressure.The bonding between the nearest neighbors is found to be of  covalent character, hence Ga2  dimers are seen as the fundamental building blocks of the crystal. The compound with arsenic,  gallium arsenide is a semiconductor commonly used in  light-emitting diodes.High-purity gallium is attacked slowly by  mineral acids. History
Gallium (Latin Gallia meaning  Gaul (essentially modern France); also gallus, meaning "rooster") was discovered  spectroscopically by  Lecoq de Boisbaudran in  1875 by its characteristic spectrum (two  violet lines) in an examination of a  zinc blende from the  Pyrenees. Before its discovery, most of its properties had been predicted and described by Dmitri Mendeleev (who called the hypothetical element  eka-aluminium) on the basis of its position in his periodic table. Later, in 1875, Boisbaudran obtained the free metal through the  electrolysis of its  hydroxide in  KOH solution. He named the element "gallia" after his native land of France and, in one of those multilingual  puns so beloved of men of science of the early 19th century, after himself, as 'Lecoq' = the  rooster, and Latin for rooster is "gallus". Occurrence
Gallium does not exist in free form in nature, nor do any high-gallium minerals exist to serve as a primary source of extraction of the element or its compounds. Gallium is rather found and extracted as a trace component in  bauxite, coal,  diaspore,  germanite, and  sphalerite. The  USGS estimates gallium reserves based on 50 ppm by weight concentration in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores. Some  flue  dusts from burning coal have been shown to contain as much as 1.5 percent gallium.Most gallium is extracted from the crude  aluminium hydroxide solution of the  Bayer process for producing alumina and aluminium. A mercury cell  electrolysis and  hydrolysis of the  amalgam with sodium hydroxide leads to sodium gallate. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, further purification is carried out using  zone melting, or else single crystal extraction from a melt ( Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially widely available. Applications
As a component of the semiconductor  Gallium arsenide, the most common application for gallium is analog integrated circuits, with the second largest use being  optoelectronic devices (mostly  laser diodes and  light-emitting diodes.)Other uses include:
Since gallium  wets glass or  porcelain, gallium can be used to create brilliant  mirrors.Used widely as a  dopant to  dope semiconductors and produce solid-state devices like  transistors.Gallium readily  alloys with most metals, and has been used as a component in  low-melting alloys. The plutonium used in  nuclear weapon pits is machined by alloying with gallium to stabilize the  allotropes of plutonium. Much research is being devoted to gallium alloys as substitutes for mercury  dental amalgams, but such compounds have yet to see wide acceptance.Gallium added in quantities up to 2% in common  solders can aid wetting and flow characteristics.Gallium is used in some high temperature thermometers.A  eutectic alloy of gallium, indium, and tin, is widely available in medical thermometers (fever thermometers), replacing problematic mercury. This alloy, with the trade name  Galinstan, has a freezing point of −20 °C.Magnesium  gallate containing impurities (such as Mn+2), is beginning to be used in ultraviolet-activated  phosphor powder.It has been suggested that a liquid gallium-tin alloy could be used to cool computer chips in place of water. As it conducts heat approximately 65 times better than water it can make a comparable  coolant.   Gallium has a  specific heat capacity of 0.37 J/(g K). Gallium's high  specific gravity of 5.91 gives it a  volumetric heat capacity of 0.37 x 5.91 = 2.187 J/cm³, meaning that a volume of gallium will heat by 4.184/2.187 = 1.9 times more than an equal volume of water in a cooling device. However given water's benign handling characteristics and plentiful abundance in most developed countries, gallium alloys are only really likely to see use in specialised applications such as cooling  supercomputers.Gallium salts such as gallium  citrate and gallium  nitrate are used as  radiopharmaceutical agents in  nuclear medicine imaging. (The form or salt is not important, since it is the free dissolved gallium ion Ga+3 which is active). For these applications, a  radioactive isotope such as 67Ga is used. The body handles Ga+3 in many ways as though it were iron, and thus it is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and also areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques. See  gallium scan. This use has largely been replaced by FDG  PET scan.Gallium is the rarest component of new  photovoltaic compounds (such as copper indium gallium selenium sulphide or Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2, recently announced by South African researchers) for use in solar panels as an alternative to  crystalline silicon, which is currently in short supply.
 Precautions
While not considered toxic, the data about gallium is inconclusive. Some sources suggest that it may cause  dermatitis from prolonged exposure; other tests have not caused a positive reaction. Like most metals, finely divided gallium loses its luster. Powdered gallium appears gray. When gallium is handled with bare hands, the extremely fine dispersion of liquid gallium droplets which results from wetting skin with the metal may appear as a gray skin stain.

Much research is being devoted to gallium alloys as substitutes for mercury  dental amalgams, but such compounds have yet to see wide acceptance.Gallium added in quantities up to 2% in common  solders can aid wetting and flow characteristics.Gallium is used in some high temperature thermometers.A  eutectic alloy of gallium, indium, and tin, is widely available in medical thermometers (fever thermometers), replacing problematic mercury. This alloy, with the trade name  Galinstan, has a freezing point of −20 °C.Magnesium  gallate containing impurities (such as Mn+2), is beginning to be used in ultraviolet-activated  phosphor powder.It has been suggested that a liquid gallium-tin alloy could be used to cool computer chips in place of water. As it conducts heat approximately 65 times better than water it can make a comparable  coolant.   Gallium has a  specific heat capacity of 0.37 J/(g K). Gallium's high  specific gravity of 5.91 gives it a  volumetric heat capacity of 0.37 x 5.91 = 2.187 J/cm³, meaning that a volume of gallium will heat by 4.184/2.187 = 1.9 times more than an equal volume of water in a cooling device. However given water's benign handling characteristics and plentiful abundance in most developed countries, gallium alloys are only really likely to see use in specialised applications such as cooling  supercomputers.Gallium salts such as gallium  citrate and gallium  nitrate are used as  radiopharmaceutical agents in  nuclear medicine imaging. (The form or salt is not important, since it is the free dissolved gallium ion Ga+3 which is active). For these applications, a  radioactive isotope such as 67Ga is used. The body handles Ga+3 in many ways as though it were iron, and thus it is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and also areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques. See  gallium scan. This use has largely been replaced by FDG  PET scan.Gallium is the rarest component of new  photovoltaic compounds (such as copper indium gallium selenium sulphide or Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2, recently announced by South African researchers) for use in solar panels as an alternative to  crystalline silicon, which is currently in short supply.
 Precautions
While not considered toxic, the data about gallium is inconclusive. Some sources suggest that it may cause  dermatitis from prolonged exposure; other tests have not caused a positive reaction. Like most metals, finely divided gallium loses its luster. Powdered gallium appears gray. When gallium is handled with bare hands, the extremely fine dispersion of liquid gallium droplets which results from wetting skin with the metal may appear as a gray skin stain.

Gallium does not crystallize in any of the simple  crystal structures. The stable phase under normal conditions is  orthorhombic with 8 atoms in the conventional  unit cell. Each atom has only one nearest neighbour (at a distance of 244  pm) and six other neighbors within additional 39 pm. Many stable and  metastable phases are found as function of temperature and pressure.The bonding between the nearest neighbors is found to be of  covalent character, hence Ga2  dimers are seen as the fundamental building blocks of the crystal. The compound with arsenic,  gallium arsenide is a semiconductor commonly used in  light-emitting diodes.High-purity gallium is attacked slowly by  mineral acids. History
Gallium (Latin Gallia meaning  Gaul (essentially modern France); also gallus, meaning "rooster") was discovered  spectroscopically by  Lecoq de Boisbaudran in  1875 by its characteristic spectrum (two  violet lines) in an examination of a  zinc blende from the  Pyrenees. Before its discovery, most of its properties had been predicted and described by Dmitri Mendeleev (who called the hypothetical element  eka-aluminium) on the basis of its position in his periodic table. Later, in 1875, Boisbaudran obtained the free metal through the  electrolysis of its  hydroxide in  KOH solution. He named the element "gallia" after his native land of France and, in one of those multilingual  puns so beloved of men of science of the early 19th century, after himself, as 'Lecoq' = the  rooster, and Latin for rooster is "gallus". Occurrence
Gallium does not exist in free form in nature, nor do any high-gallium minerals exist to serve as a primary source of extraction of the element or its compounds. Gallium is rather found and extracted as a trace component in  bauxite, coal,  diaspore,  germanite, and  sphalerite. The  USGS estimates gallium reserves based on 50 ppm by weight concentration in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores. Some  flue  dusts from burning coal have been shown to contain as much as 1.5 percent gallium.Most gallium is extracted from the crude  aluminium hydroxide solution of the  Bayer process for producing alumina and aluminium. A mercury cell  electrolysis and  hydrolysis of the  amalgam with sodium hydroxide leads to sodium gallate. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, further purification is carried out using  zone melting, or else single crystal extraction from a melt ( Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially widely available. Applications
As a component of the semiconductor  Gallium arsenide, the most common application for gallium is analog integrated circuits, with the second largest use being  optoelectronic devices (mostly  laser diodes and  light-emitting diodes.)Other uses include:

This use has largely been replaced by FDG  PET scan.Gallium is the rarest component of new  photovoltaic compounds (such as copper indium gallium selenium sulphide or Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2, recently announced by South African researchers) for use in solar panels as an alternative to  crystalline silicon, which is currently in short supply.
 Precautions
While not considered toxic, the data about gallium is inconclusive. Some sources suggest that it may cause  dermatitis from prolonged exposure; other tests have not caused a positive reaction. Like most metals, finely divided gallium loses its luster. Powdered gallium appears gray. When gallium is handled with bare hands, the extremely fine dispersion of liquid gallium droplets which results from wetting skin with the metal may appear as a gray skin stain.

Gallium does not exist in free form in nature, nor do any high-gallium minerals exist to serve as a primary source of extraction of the element or its compounds. Gallium is rather found and extracted as a trace component in  bauxite, coal,  diaspore,  germanite, and  sphalerite. The  USGS estimates gallium reserves based on 50 ppm by weight concentration in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores. Some  flue  dusts from burning coal have been shown to contain as much as 1.5 percent gallium.Most gallium is extracted from the crude  aluminium hydroxide solution of the  Bayer process for producing alumina and aluminium. A mercury cell  electrolysis and  hydrolysis of the  amalgam with sodium hydroxide leads to sodium gallate. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, further purification is carried out using  zone melting, or else single crystal extraction from a melt ( Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially widely available. Applications
As a component of the semiconductor  Gallium arsenide, the most common application for gallium is analog integrated circuits, with the second largest use being  optoelectronic devices (mostly  laser diodes and  light-emitting diodes.)Other uses include:
Since gallium  wets glass or  porcelain, gallium can be used to create brilliant  mirrors.Used widely as a  dopant to  dope semiconductors and produce solid-state devices like  transistors.Gallium readily  alloys with most metals, and has been used as a component in  low-melting alloys. The plutonium used in  nuclear weapon pits is machined by alloying with gallium to stabilize the  allotropes of plutonium. Much research is being devoted to gallium alloys as substitutes for mercury  dental amalgams, but such compounds have yet to see wide acceptance.Gallium added in quantities up to 2% in common  solders can aid wetting and flow characteristics.Gallium is used in some high temperature thermometers.A  eutectic alloy of gallium, indium, and tin, is widely available in medical thermometers (fever thermometers), replacing problematic mercury. This alloy, with the trade name  Galinstan, has a freezing point of −20 °C.Magnesium  gallate containing impurities (such as Mn+2), is beginning to be used in ultraviolet-activated  phosphor powder.It has been suggested that a liquid gallium-tin alloy could be used to cool computer chips in place of water. As it conducts heat approximately 65 times better than water it can make a comparable  coolant.   Gallium has a  specific heat capacity of 0.37 J/(g K). Gallium's high  specific gravity of 5.91 gives it a  volumetric heat capacity of 0.37 x 5.91 = 2.187 J/cm³, meaning that a volume of gallium will heat by 4.184/2.187 = 1.9 times more than an equal volume of water in a cooling device. However given water's benign handling characteristics and plentiful abundance in most developed countries, gallium alloys are only really likely to see use in specialised applications such as cooling  supercomputers.Gallium salts such as gallium  citrate and gallium  nitrate are used as  radiopharmaceutical agents in  nuclear medicine imaging. (The form or salt is not important, since it is the free dissolved gallium ion Ga+3 which is active). For these applications, a  radioactive isotope such as 67Ga is used. The body handles Ga+3 in many ways as though it were iron, and thus it is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and also areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques. See  gallium scan.
