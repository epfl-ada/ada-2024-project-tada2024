A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials. The most common form is known as a  residential garden. Western gardens are almost universally based around plants.  Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens. Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as  Zen gardens, use plants sparsely or not at all. Food-producing gardens are distinguished from  farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby rather than produce for sale). The gardening article discusses the differences and similarities between gardens and farms in greater detail.Gardening is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden. This work is done by an amateur or professional  gardener. A gardener might also work in a non-garden setting, such as a park, a roadside embankment, or other  public space.  Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with  landscape architects tending to specialise in design for public and corporate clients.
 Garden planning and design
Garden planning and  garden design may be undertaken by a professional. A  landscape architect is a professional who can plan and realise outdoor spaces. A  garden designer is usually trained to plan and realise residential gardens.The planner must give consideration to many factors:
PurposeExisting conditionsFinancial constraintsMaintenance implications
 Elements of a garden
The elements of a garden consist of natural conditions and materials, as well as man-made elements:Natural conditions and materials:
Soil RocksLight conditionsWindPrecipitationAir quality 
PollutionProximity to ocean (salinity)

Man-made elements:
 Terrace, patio, deckPaths LightingRaised bedsOutdoor art/sculpture, such as  GazebosPool,  water garden, or other water elements

Plant  cultivation
Observance of nature 
Bird- and insect-watchingReflection on the changing seasons
Relaxation
