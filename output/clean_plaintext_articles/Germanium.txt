Germanium ( IPA: /dʒə(r)ˈmeɪniəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Ge and  atomic number 32. This is a lustrous, hard, silver-white  metalloid that is chemically similar to tin. Germanium forms a large number of  organometallic compounds and is an important semiconductor material used in  transistors.
 Notable characteristics
Germanium is a hard, grayish-white element that has a metallic luster and the same crystal structure as diamond. In addition, it is important to note that germanium is a semiconductor, with electrical properties between those of a metal and an  insulator. In its pure state, this metalloid is crystalline, brittle and retains its  lustre in air at room temperature.  Zone refining techniques have led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that have an impurity of only one part in 1010. History
In  1871 germanium (Latin Germania for Germany) was one of the elements that Dmitri Mendeleev  predicted to exist as a missing  analogue of the silicon group (Mendeleev called it " ekasilicon"). The existence of this element was proven by  Clemens Winkler in  1886. This discovery was an important confirmation of Mendeleev's idea of element periodicity.

The development of the germanium transistor opened the door to countless applications of  solid state electronics. From  1950 through the early  1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors,  diodes, and rectifiers. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but requires much higher purity samples—a purity which could not be commercially achieved in the early days. Meanwhile, demand for germanium in  fibre optics communication networks, infrared  night vision systems, and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% of worldwide germanium consumption for  2000. Applications
Unlike most semiconductors, germanium has a small  band gap, allowing it to efficiently respond to  infrared light. It is therefore used in infrared  spectroscopes and other optical equipment which require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. Its oxide's  index of refraction and dispersion properties make germanium useful in wide-angle  camera lenses and in microscope objective lenses.Germanium transistors are still used in some  stompboxes by musicians who wish to reproduce the distinctive tonal character of the  "fuzz"-tone from the early  rock and roll era. Vintage  stompboxes known to contain germanium transistors have shown marked increases in collector value for this reason alone.The alloy Silicon germanide (commonly referred to as "silicon-germanium", or  SiGe) is rapidly becoming an important semiconductor material, for use in high speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilising the properties of Si-SiGe junctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone.

Other uses:
 Alloying agent (see below)Phosphor in  fluorescent lamps catalystHigh purity germanium single crystal detectors can precisely identify radiation sources (e.g. for airport security)Germanium substrate wafers for high-efficiency multi-junction solar cells for space applications
Certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to mammals, but have toxic effects against certain bacteria. This property makes these compounds useful as chemotherapeutic agents.Germanium is useful for  single crystal  neutron or  synchrotron X-ray  monochromator for  beamlines. The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and  High energy X-ray applications.While germanium has been claimed as an attractive nutritional supply, able to cure even cancer and AIDS,  FDA research has concluded that the offered supplements "present potential human health hazard".In recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys. In  sterling silver alloys, for instance, it has been found to reduce  firescale, increase tarnish resistance, and increase the alloy's response to precipitation hardening (see  Argentium sterling silver). Occurrence
This element is found in  argyrodite ( sulfide of germanium and silver); coal;  germanite; zinc ores; and other minerals. See also  Category:Germanium mineralsGermanium is obtained commercially from zinc ore processing smelter dust and from the  combustion by-products of certain coals. A large reserve of this element is therefore in coal sources.This metalloid can be extracted from other metals by fractional  distillation of its volatile tetrachloride. This technique permits the production of ultra-high purity germanium. Value
In  1998 the cost of germanium was about US$3 per  gram. The yearend price for zone-refined germanium has (generally) decreased since then:


2000.....$1,150 per  kilogram (or $1.15 per gram)2001.....$890 per kilogram (or $0.89 per gram)2002.....$620 per kilogram (or $0.62 per gram)2003.....$380 per kilogram (or $0.38 per gram)2004.....$600 per kilogram (or $0.60 per gram)2005.....$610 per kilogram (or $0.61 per gram)2006.....$720 per kilogram (or $0.72 per gram)

 Compounds
Some  inorganic germanium compounds include  Germane or  Germanium tetrahydride (GeH4),  Germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4), and  Germanium dioxide (germania) (GeO2). Some  organic compounds of germanium include tetramethylgermane or tetramethyl germanium, (Ge(CH3)4), and tetraethylgermane or tetraethyl germanium, (Ge(C2H5)4). Recently a new organogermanium compound  isobutylgermane ((CH3)2CHCH2GeH3), was reported as the less hazardous liquid substitute for toxic  germane gas in semiconductor applications.See also  Category:Germanium compounds Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium"

Unlike most semiconductors, germanium has a small  band gap, allowing it to efficiently respond to  infrared light. It is therefore used in infrared  spectroscopes and other optical equipment which require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. Its oxide's  index of refraction and dispersion properties make germanium useful in wide-angle  camera lenses and in microscope objective lenses.Germanium transistors are still used in some  stompboxes by musicians who wish to reproduce the distinctive tonal character of the  "fuzz"-tone from the early  rock and roll era. Vintage  stompboxes known to contain germanium transistors have shown marked increases in collector value for this reason alone.The alloy Silicon germanide (commonly referred to as "silicon-germanium", or  SiGe) is rapidly becoming an important semiconductor material, for use in high speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilising the properties of Si-SiGe junctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone.

 Alloying agent (see below)Phosphor in  fluorescent lamps catalystHigh purity germanium single crystal detectors can precisely identify radiation sources (e.g. for airport security)Germanium substrate wafers for high-efficiency multi-junction solar cells for space applications
Certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to mammals, but have toxic effects against certain bacteria. This property makes these compounds useful as chemotherapeutic agents.Germanium is useful for  single crystal  neutron or  synchrotron X-ray  monochromator for  beamlines. The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and  High energy X-ray applications.While germanium has been claimed as an attractive nutritional supply, able to cure even cancer and AIDS,  FDA research has concluded that the offered supplements "present potential human health hazard".In recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys. In  sterling silver alloys, for instance, it has been found to reduce  firescale, increase tarnish resistance, and increase the alloy's response to precipitation hardening (see  Argentium sterling silver).

Some  organic compounds of germanium include tetramethylgermane or tetramethyl germanium, (Ge(CH3)4), and tetraethylgermane or tetraethyl germanium, (Ge(C2H5)4). Recently a new organogermanium compound  isobutylgermane ((CH3)2CHCH2GeH3), was reported as the less hazardous liquid substitute for toxic  germane gas in semiconductor applications.See also  Category:Germanium compounds Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium"




In  1998 the cost of germanium was about US$3 per  gram. The yearend price for zone-refined germanium has (generally) decreased since then:


2000.....$1,150 per  kilogram (or $1.15 per gram)2001.....$890 per kilogram (or $0.89 per gram)2002.....$620 per kilogram (or $0.62 per gram)2003.....$380 per kilogram (or $0.38 per gram)2004.....$600 per kilogram (or $0.60 per gram)2005.....$610 per kilogram (or $0.61 per gram)2006.....$720 per kilogram (or $0.72 per gram)
