Gold(III) chloride, traditionally called auric chloride, is one of the most common  compounds of gold. It has the formula AuCl3. The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an  oxidation state of +3, which is the most stable form for gold in its compounds. Gold also forms another  chloride, gold(I) chloride (AuCl) which is less stable than AuCl3. Also chlorauric acid (HAuCl4), the product formed when gold dissolves in  aqua regia, is sometimes referred to rather loosely as "gold chloride", "acid gold trichloride" or even "gold(III) chloride trihydrate".Gold(III) chloride is very  hygroscopic and highly soluble in water and ethanol. It decomposes above 160 °C or in light, and it forms a variety of  complexes with many  ligands.
 Structure
 AuCl3 exists as a  dimer both as a solid and as a vapour; the bromide  AuBr3 follows the same pattern. Each Au centre is square planar. This structure is reminiscent of the bi tetrahedral structures adopted by AlCl3 and FeCl3. The bonding in AuCl3 is mainly  covalent, reflecting the high oxidation state and relatively high  electronegativity (for a metal) of the gold. Chemical properties
 Anhydrous AuCl3 begins to decompose to  AuCl at around 160 °C; however, this will in turn undergo  disproportionation at higher temperatures to give gold metal and AuCl3.AuCl3 → AuCl + Cl2 (>160 °C)3 AuCl → AuCl3 + 2 Au (>420 °C)AuCl3 is a  Lewis acid which readily forms complexes. For example with hydrochloric acid, chlorauric acid (HAuCl4) is formed:HCl( aq) + AuCl3(aq) → H+AuCl4−(aq)Ionic chlorides such as  KCl will also form the AuCl4− ion with AuCl3.Aqueous solutions of AuCl3 react with alkalis such as sodium hydroxide to form a  precipitate of impure Au(OH)3, which will dissolve in excess NaOH to form sodium aurate (NaAuO2). If gently heated, Au(OH)3 decomposes to  gold(III) oxide (Au2O3) and then to gold metal. Preparation
Gold(III) chloride is most often prepared by direct  chlorination of the metal at high temperatures:2 Au + 3 Cl2 → 2 AuCl3 Uses
Gold(III) chloride is one of the most common gold compounds and it is therefore used as the starting point for the synthesis of many other gold compounds, for example the water-soluble  cyanide  complex KAu(CN)4:AuCl3 + 4  KCN → KAu(CN)4 + 3  KClGold(III) salts, especially NaAuCl4 (made from AuCl3 +  NaCl), provide a non-toxic alternative to mercury(II) salts as  catalysts for  alkyne reactions. One important reaction of this sort is the hydration of terminal alkynes to produce methyl  ketones, for example:Ketones are generally formed in over 90% yield under these conditions. Also useful is the related  amination of alkynes which can use gold(III) catalysis.In recent years AuCl3 has begun to attract the interest of organic chemists as a mild acid catalyst for other reactions such as  alkylation of  aromatics and a conversion of  furans to  phenols (see below). Such reactions find use in  organic synthesis and in the  pharmaceutical industry. For example,  2-methylfuran (sylvan) undergoes smooth alkylation by  methyl vinyl ketone at the 5-position:The reaction gives a 91% yield in only 40 minutes at room temperature, using only 1 mole% of AuCl3 in  acetonitrile. This yield is noteworthy since both the furan and the ketone are normally very sensitive to side-reactions such as polymerisation under acidic conditions. In some cases where  alkynes are present, a phenol may be formed:The reaction undergoes a complex rearrangement that leads to formation of the new aromatic ring. Precautions
Gold(III) chloride should be handled wearing gloves and goggles, and direct contact with the material should be avoided. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold%28III%29_chloride"

If gently heated, Au(OH)3 decomposes to  gold(III) oxide (Au2O3) and then to gold metal. Preparation
Gold(III) chloride is most often prepared by direct  chlorination of the metal at high temperatures:2 Au + 3 Cl2 → 2 AuCl3 Uses
Gold(III) chloride is one of the most common gold compounds and it is therefore used as the starting point for the synthesis of many other gold compounds, for example the water-soluble  cyanide  complex KAu(CN)4:AuCl3 + 4  KCN → KAu(CN)4 + 3  KClGold(III) salts, especially NaAuCl4 (made from AuCl3 +  NaCl), provide a non-toxic alternative to mercury(II) salts as  catalysts for  alkyne reactions. One important reaction of this sort is the hydration of terminal alkynes to produce methyl  ketones, for example:Ketones are generally formed in over 90% yield under these conditions. Also useful is the related  amination of alkynes which can use gold(III) catalysis.In recent years AuCl3 has begun to attract the interest of organic chemists as a mild acid catalyst for other reactions such as  alkylation of  aromatics and a conversion of  furans to  phenols (see below). Such reactions find use in  organic synthesis and in the  pharmaceutical industry. For example,  2-methylfuran (sylvan) undergoes smooth alkylation by  methyl vinyl ketone at the 5-position:The reaction gives a 91% yield in only 40 minutes at room temperature, using only 1 mole% of AuCl3 in  acetonitrile. This yield is noteworthy since both the furan and the ketone are normally very sensitive to side-reactions such as polymerisation under acidic conditions. In some cases where  alkynes are present, a phenol may be formed:The reaction undergoes a complex rearrangement that leads to formation of the new aromatic ring. Precautions
Gold(III) chloride should be handled wearing gloves and goggles, and direct contact with the material should be avoided. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold%28III%29_chloride"




Aqueous solutions of AuCl3 react with alkalis such as sodium hydroxide to form a  precipitate of impure Au(OH)3, which will dissolve in excess NaOH to form sodium aurate (NaAuO2). If gently heated, Au(OH)3 decomposes to  gold(III) oxide (Au2O3) and then to gold metal. Preparation
