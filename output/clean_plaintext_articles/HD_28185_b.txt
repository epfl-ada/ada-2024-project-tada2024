HD 28185 b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the Sun-like star HD 28185. The planet is located in a near-circular  orbit in its star's  habitable zone. HD 28185 b was discovered in  2001 as a part of the CORALIE survey for southern extrasolar planets.
 Discovery
Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, HD 28185 b was discovered by detecting small periodic variations in the  radial velocity of its parent star caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet. This was achieved by measuring the  Doppler shift of the star's  spectrum. In  2001 it was announced that HD 28185 exhibited a wobble along the line of sight with a period of 383 days, with an  amplitude indicating a  mass 5.72 times that of Jupiter. Orbit and mass
HD 28185 b takes 1.04  years to orbit its parent star. Unlike most known long- period planets, the orbit of HD 28185 b has a low  eccentricity, comparable to that of Mars in our solar system. The orbit lies entirely within its star's habitable zone.The amplitude of the radial velocity oscillations means that the planet has a mass at least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in our solar system. However, the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet's mass, depending on the orbital  inclination to our  line of sight. Therefore the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit. Characteristics
Given the planet's high mass, it is most likely to be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet has only been detected indirectly through observations of the star, properties such as its  radius, composition and  temperature are unknown.Since HD 28185 b orbits in its star's habitable zone, some have speculated on the possibility of life on worlds in the HD 28185 system. While it is unknown whether gas giants can support life, simulations of tidal interactions suggest that HD 28185 b could harbour Earth-mass  satellites in orbit around it for many billions of years. Such moons, if they exist, may be able to provide a habitable environment, though it is unclear whether such satellites would form in the first place. Additionally, a small planet in one of the gas giant's  Trojan points could survive in a habitable orbit for long periods. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_28185_b"
