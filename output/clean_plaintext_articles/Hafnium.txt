Hafnium ( IPA: /ˈhæfniəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Hf and  atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray tetravalent  transition metal, hafnium resembles zirconium chemically and is found in zirconium minerals. Hafnium is used in tungsten  alloys in filaments and  electrodes and also acts as a neutron absorber in  control rods in  nuclear power plants.
 Notable characteristics


 Hafnium metal


Hafnium is a shiny silvery, ductile metal that is corrosion resistant and chemically similar to zirconium. The properties of hafnium are markedly affected by zirconium impurities and these two elements are amongst the most difficult to separate. The only notable difference between them is their density (zirconium is about half as dense as hafnium). Hafnium carbide is the most  refractory  binary compound known and  hafnium nitride is the most refractory of all known metal nitrides with a  melting point of 3310  °C. This metal is resistant to concentrated  alkalis, but  halogens react with it to form hafnium tetrahalides. At higher temperatures hafnium reacts with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. The  nuclear isomer Hf-178-m2 is also a source of cascades of  gamma rays whose energies total to 2.45  MeV per decay. It is notable because it has the highest excitation energy of any comparably long-lived isomer of any element. One gram of pure Hf-178-m2 would contain approximately 1330 megajoules of energy, the equivalent of exploding about 317 kilograms (700 pounds) of  TNT. Possible applications requiring such highly concentrated energy storage are of interest. For example, it has been studied as a possible power source for gamma ray  lasers. Applications
Hafnium is used to make control rods for  nuclear reactors because of its ability to absorb neutrons (its thermal neutron absorption cross section is nearly 600 times that of zirconium), excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties.Other uses:
In gas-filled and  incandescent lamps, for scavenging oxygen and nitrogen,As the electrode in  plasma cutting because of its ability to shed electrons into air,and in iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and other metal  alloys. Hafnium dioxide is a candidate for  High-K gate insulators in future generations of  integrated circuits. DARPA has been intermittently funding programs in the US to determine the possibility of using a  nuclear isomer of hafnium (the above mentioned Hf-178-m2) to construct small, high yield weapons with simple x-ray triggering mechanisms—an application of  induced gamma emission. That work follows over two decades of basic research by an international community  into the means for releasing the stored energy upon demand. There is considerable opposition to this program, both because the idea may not work and because uninvolved countries might perceive an imagined "isomer weapon gap" that would justify their further development and stockpiling of conventional nuclear weapons. A related proposal is to use the same isomer to power  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, which could remain airborne for weeks at a time.
 History
Hafnium (Latin Hafnia for "Copenhagen", the home town of Niels Bohr) was discovered by  Dirk Coster and  Georg von Hevesy in  1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Soon after, the new element was predicted to be associated with zirconium by using the Bohr theory and was finally found in zircon through  X-ray  spectroscope analysis in Norway.It was separated from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of double  ammonium or potassium fluorides by Jantzen and von Hevesey. Metallic hafnium was first prepared by  Anton Eduard van Arkel and  Jan Hendrik de Boer by passing tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament.The  Faculty of Science of the  University of Copenhagen uses in its  seal a stylized image of hafnium. Occurrence
Hafnium is found combined in natural zirconium compounds but it does not exist as a free element in nature. Minerals that contain zirconium, such as alvite [(Hf, Th, Zr)SiO4 H2O,  thortveitite and  zircon (ZrSiO4), usually contain between 1 and 5% hafnium. Hafnium and zirconium have nearly identical chemistry, which makes the two difficult to separate. About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced by a by-product of zirconium refinement. This is done through reducing  hafnium(IV) chloride with magnesium or sodium in the  Kroll process. Precautions
Care needs to be taken when machining hafnium because when it is divided into fine particles, it is  pyrophoric and can ignite spontaneously in air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people and the pure metal is not normally toxic but all its compounds should be handled as if they are toxic (although there appears to be limited danger to exposed individuals).
