The term hawk refers to birds of prey in any of three senses:
Strictly, to mean any of the  species in the bird sub-family Accipitrinae in the  genera  Accipiter,  Micronisus,  Melierax,  Urotriorchis, and  Megatriorchis. The large and widespread Accipiter genus includes  goshawks, sparrowhawks , the  Sharp-shinned Hawk and others. They are mainly woodland birds that hunt by sudden dashes from a concealed perch. They usually have long tails and high visual acuity.

More generally, to mean small to medium-sized birds that are members of the  Accipitridae, the family which includes the true hawks (Accipiters) and also eagles, kites,  harriers,  buzzards, and  Old World vultures.

Loosely, to mean almost any bird of prey.
The common names of birds in various parts of the world often use hawk loosely. For example, in North America, the  Buteos are called "hawks".In February  2005 the Canadian  scientist  Dr Louis Lefebvre announced a method of measuring avian  IQ in terms of their innovation in feeding habits. Hawks were named among the most intelligent birds based on this scale.Hawks are believed to have vision as good as 20/2, about eight times more acute than humans with good eyesight. This is because of many photoreceptors in the retina (Up to 1,000,000 per square mm, against 200,000 for humans), a very high number of nerves connecting the receptors to the brain, a second set of eye muscles not found in other animals, and an indented fovea, which magnifies the central part of the visual field.

 Hawks and humans

Hawks are sometimes used in  falconry, a sport in which trained hawks, eagles or falcons, are used to pursue and catch small game.In the US, hawks are sometimes shot for sport or by ranchers who believe the birds may depredate livestock. This makes hawk  conservation an issue in some areas. In other parts of the world, most hawk species are protected by law
