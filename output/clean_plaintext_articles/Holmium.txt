Holmium ( IPA: /ˈhəʊlmiəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Ho and  atomic number 67. Part of the  lanthanide series, holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white metallic element, which is stable in dry air at room temperature. A  rare earth metal, it is found in the minerals  monazite and  gadolinite.
 Notable characteristics
A trivalent metallic rare earth element, holmium has the highest  magnetic moment (10.6µB) of any naturally-occurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties. When combined with yttrium, it forms highly magnetic compounds.Holmium is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly corrosion-resistant and stable in dry air at  standard temperature and pressure. In moist air and at higher  temperatures, however, it quickly  oxidizes, forming a yellowish oxide. In pure form, holmium possesses a metallic, bright silvery luster. Applications
Because of its magnetic properties, holmium has been used to create the strongest artificially-generated  magnetic fields when placed within high-strength magnets as a  magnetic pole piece (also called a  magnetic flux concentrator). Since it can absorb nuclear fission-bred neutrons, the element is also used in  nuclear control rods. Other commercial applications of the element include;
its very high magnetic moment is suitable for use in yttrium-iron- garnet (YIG) and yttrium-lanthanum- fluoride (YLF)  solid state lasers found in  microwave equipment (which are in turn found in a variety of medical and dental settings).

Holmium oxide is used as a yellow glass coloring.Holmium is used in a laser to break up  kidney stones while being minimally invasive
Few other uses have been identified for this element. History
Holmium (Holmia, Latin name for Stockholm) was  discovered by  Marc Delafontaine and  Jacques Louis Soret in  1878 who noticed the aberrant  spectrographic  absorption bands of the then-unknown element (they called it "Element X"). Later in 1878,  Per Teodor Cleve independently discovered the element while he was working on  erbia earth ( erbium oxide).Using the method developed by  Carl Gustaf Mosander, Cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia. The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance holmia (after the Latin name for Cleve's home town, Stockholm) and the green one thulia. Holmia was later found to be the  holmium oxide and thulia was  thulium oxide. Occurrence
Like all other rare earths, holmium is not naturally found as a free element. It does occur combined with other elements in the minerals  gadolinite,  monazite, and in other rare-earth minerals. It is commercially extracted via  ion-exchange from monazite sand (0.05% holmium) but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths. The element has been isolated through the  reduction of its anhydrous  chloride or  fluoride with metallic calcium. Its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is 1.3 milligrams per kilogram. Isotopes
Natural holmium contains one  stable  isotope, holmium 165. Some synthetic radioactive isotopes are known, the most stable one is holmium 163, with a half life of 4570 years. All other radioisotopes have half lives not greater than 1.117 days, and most have half lives under 3 hours. Precautions
The element, as with other rare earths, appears to have a low acute  toxic rating. Holmium plays no biological role in humans but may be able to stimulate  metabolism. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmium"
