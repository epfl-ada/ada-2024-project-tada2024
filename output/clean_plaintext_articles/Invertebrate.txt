Invertebrate is a term coined by  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck to describe any animal without a  spinal column. The group includes 97% of all animal  species—all animals except vertebrates (fish, reptiles,  amphibians, birds and mammals).Lamarck followed Linnaeus' division of these animals into two groups, the Insecta and the  Vermes, but they are now classified into over 30  phyla, from simple organisms such as  sponges and  flatworms to complex animals such as arthropods and  molluscs.Since invertebrates include all animals except a certain group, invertebrates form a  paraphyletic group. (For a full list of animals considered to be invertebrates, see animal.) All the listed phyla are invertebrates along with two of the three  subphyla in Phylum Chordata:  Urochordata and  Cephalochordata. These two, plus all the other known invertebrates, have only one cluster of  Hox genes, while the vertebrates have duplicated their original cluster more than once. Phyla and common examples

 Porifera — sponges Cnidarians — jellyfish Platyhelminthes — flatworms Nematoda — roundworms Annelida — earthworms Echinodermata — sea star, sea urchins, sea cucumbers Mollusca — squid, snailsArthropoda — insects, ticks, spiders, grasshoppers, lobsters, crabs Bryozoa — moss animals, sea mats (occasionally resemble corals)
