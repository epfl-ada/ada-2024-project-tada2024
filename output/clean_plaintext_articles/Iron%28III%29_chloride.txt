Iron(III) chloride, generically called ferric chloride, is the  chemical compound with the formula FeCl3. The crystals appear a dark green colour by reflected light, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red as its colour depends upon the viewing angle. It is  deliquescent, fuming in moist air due to the evolution of HCl, which hydrates, giving a mist. When dissolved in water, FeCl3 undergoes  hydrolysis and gives off a great deal of heat as it is an  exothermic reaction. The resulting brown, acidic solution, which is corrosive, is used as a  coagulant in treating sewage and drinking water and as an etchant for copper-based metals (such as those found in  printed circuit boards) and  stainless steel.Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is a fairly strong  Lewis acid, and it is used as a catalyst in  organic synthesis. The brownish-yellow  hexahydrate is a common commercial form of ferric chloride, a yellowish species described by the formula [FeCl2(H2O)4]Cl.2H2O (compare  chromium(III) chloride).
 Structure
FeCl3 adopts the BI3 structure, which features octahedral Fe(III) centres and three-coordinate chloride ligands. FeCl3 has a relatively low melting point, and boils at around 315 °C. The vapour consists of the dimer Fe2Cl6 (compare aluminium chloride) that is increasingly dissociated into the monomer at higher temperature, in competition with the reversible decomposition to give  FeCl2 and Cl2. Chemical properties
Iron(III) chloride is a moderately strong  Lewis acid which forms adducts with  Lewis bases such as  triphenylphosphine oxide, e.g. FeCl3(OPPh3)2 where Ph =  phenyl. FeCl3 reacts with  chloride salts to give the yellow  tetrahedral FeCl4− ion. Solutions of FeCl4− in hydrochloric acid may be extracted into  diethyl ether.When heated with  iron(III) oxide at 350 °C, FeCl3 gives the oxychloride FeOCl. In the presence of base, iron(III) chloride may undergo replacement of chloride, for example to produce an alkoxide:
FeCl3 + 3 C2H5OH + 3 NH3 → Fe(OC2H5)3 + 3  NH4Cl
 Carboxylate salts such as  oxalate,  citrate or  tartrate react easily with aqueous FeCl3 to form stable complexes such as [Fe(C2O4)3]3−.Iron(III) chloride is also a mild  oxidising agent, capable (for example) of oxidising copper(I) chloride to  copper(II) chloride. Reducing agents such as  hydrazine convert FeCl3 to complexes of iron(II). Preparation and production
Anhydrous iron(III) chloride may be prepared by union of the elements:
2Fe( s) + 3Cl2(g) → 2FeCl3( s)
The solution of iron(III) chloride is produced on industrial scale via two methods, from iron and from ore, in a closed-loop process.
Dissolving pure iron in iron(III) chloride solution:



Fe(s) + 2FeCl3(aq) → 3FeCl2(aq)


Dissolving  iron ore in hydrochloric acid:



Fe3O4(s) + 8HCl(aq) → FeCl2(aq) + 2FeCl3(aq) + 4H2O


Upgrading the  iron(II) chloride with chlorine:



FeCl2(aq) + Cl2(g) → FeCl3(aq)

Alternatively, ferrous chloride can be oxidized with  sulfur dioxide:


32FeCl2 + 8SO2 + 32HCl → 32 FeCl3 + S8 + 16H2O

Hydrated FeCl3(H2O)n can be converted to the anhydrous salt by heating with  thionyl chloride. The hydrate cannot be converted to FeCl3 by heat, instead HCl is evolved and FeOCl forms Uses
Iron(III) chloride is probably most widely used for etching copper in the production of printed circuit boards. This occurs by the  redox reaction


FeCl3 + Cu →  FeCl2 + CuCl followed by FeCl3 + CuCl →  FeCl2 +  CuCl2

Iron(III) chloride is also used as a catalyst for the reaction of  ethylene with chlorine, forming ethylene dichloride ( 1,2-Dichloroethane), an important commodity chemical, which is mainly used for the industrial production of  vinyl chloride, the  monomer for making  PVC.In another industrial application, ferric chloride is an alternative to  iron(III) sulfate in water treatment, where FeCl3 is treated with  hydroxide ion to form a  floc of "iron(III) hydroxide" (more correctly formulated as FeO(OH)) that can remove suspended materials.In the laboratory iron(III) chloride is commonly employed as a  Lewis acid for  catalysing reactions such as  chlorination of  aromatic compounds and  Friedel-Crafts reaction of aromatics. It is less powerful than aluminium chloride, but in some cases this mildness leads to higher yields, for example in the alkylation of benzene:The "ferric chloride test" is a traditional colorimetric test for  phenols which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The mixture is filtered before use. The organic substance is dissolved in water,  methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised FeCl3 solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates the presence of a phenol or enol.FeCl3 is sometimes used by American coin collectors to identify the dates of  Buffalo nickels that are so badly worn that the date is no longer visible.FeCl3 is also commonly used by knife craftsmen and swordsmiths to stain blades, as to give a contrasting effect to the metal, and also to view metal layering or imperfections. Precautions
Iron(III) chloride is toxic, highly corrosive and acidic. The anhydrous material is a powerful dehydrating agent. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%28III%29_chloride"

Precautions
Iron(III) chloride is toxic, highly corrosive and acidic. The anhydrous material is a powerful dehydrating agent. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%28III%29_chloride"




 Carboxylate salts such as  oxalate,  citrate or  tartrate react easily with aqueous FeCl3 to form stable complexes such as [Fe(C2O4)3]3−.Iron(III) chloride is also a mild  oxidising agent, capable (for example) of oxidising copper(I) chloride to  copper(II) chloride. Reducing agents such as  hydrazine convert FeCl3 to complexes of iron(II). Preparation and production
Anhydrous iron(III) chloride may be prepared by union of the elements:
2Fe( s) + 3Cl2(g) → 2FeCl3( s)
The solution of iron(III) chloride is produced on industrial scale via two methods, from iron and from ore, in a closed-loop process.
Dissolving pure iron in iron(III) chloride solution:



Fe(s) + 2FeCl3(aq) → 3FeCl2(aq)


Dissolving  iron ore in hydrochloric acid:



Fe3O4(s) + 8HCl(aq) → FeCl2(aq) + 2FeCl3(aq) + 4H2O


Upgrading the  iron(II) chloride with chlorine:



FeCl2(aq) + Cl2(g) → FeCl3(aq)

Alternatively, ferrous chloride can be oxidized with  sulfur dioxide:


32FeCl2 + 8SO2 + 32HCl → 32 FeCl3 + S8 + 16H2O

Hydrated FeCl3(H2O)n can be converted to the anhydrous salt by heating with  thionyl chloride. The hydrate cannot be converted to FeCl3 by heat, instead HCl is evolved and FeOCl forms Uses
Iron(III) chloride is probably most widely used for etching copper in the production of printed circuit boards. This occurs by the  redox reaction


FeCl3 + Cu →  FeCl2 + CuCl followed by FeCl3 + CuCl →  FeCl2 +  CuCl2

Iron(III) chloride is also used as a catalyst for the reaction of  ethylene with chlorine, forming ethylene dichloride ( 1,2-Dichloroethane), an important commodity chemical, which is mainly used for the industrial production of  vinyl chloride, the  monomer for making  PVC.In another industrial application, ferric chloride is an alternative to  iron(III) sulfate in water treatment, where FeCl3 is treated with  hydroxide ion to form a  floc of "iron(III) hydroxide" (more correctly formulated as FeO(OH)) that can remove suspended materials.In the laboratory iron(III) chloride is commonly employed as a  Lewis acid for  catalysing reactions such as  chlorination of  aromatic compounds and  Friedel-Crafts reaction of aromatics. It is less powerful than aluminium chloride, but in some cases this mildness leads to higher yields, for example in the alkylation of benzene:The "ferric chloride test" is a traditional colorimetric test for  phenols which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The mixture is filtered before use. The organic substance is dissolved in water,  methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised FeCl3 solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates the presence of a phenol or enol.FeCl3 is sometimes used by American coin collectors to identify the dates of  Buffalo nickels that are so badly worn that the date is no longer visible.FeCl3 is also commonly used by knife craftsmen and swordsmiths to stain blades, as to give a contrasting effect to the metal, and also to view metal layering or imperfections.
