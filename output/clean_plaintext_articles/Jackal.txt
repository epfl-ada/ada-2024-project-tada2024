A jackal is any of four small to medium-sized members of the family  Canidae, found in Africa and Asia. (The name jackal is borrowed from Turkish Çakal which originates from the  Persian: Shaghāl ) Jackals fill a similar ecological niche to the  Coyote in North America, that of  scavengers and lesser  predators. Their long legs and curved  canine teeth are adapted for hunting small mammals, birds and reptiles. Blunt feet and fused leg bones give them a long-distance runner's physique, capable of maintaining speeds of 16km/h (10mph) for extended periods of time. They are nocturnal, most active at dawn and dusk.In jackal society the social unit is that of a monogamous pair which defends its territory from other pairs. These territories are defended by vigorously chasing intruding rivals and marking landmarks around the territory with  urine and  feces. The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults who stay with their parents until they establish their own territory. Jackals may occasionally assemble in small packs, for example to scavenge a carcass, but normally hunt alone or as a pair.Jackals are considered close to what all ancestral canids looked and behaved like. Despite their outward similarity, the four  species are not considered closely related to one another. The  Simian Jackal is actually a  wolf that is thought to have taken on the appearance of a large fox or jackal through  convergent evolution (by adopting a similar diet of small  rodents), and the other three 'true jackals' are believed to have split from each other 6  mya. The  Golden Jackal is thought to have evolved in Asia whilst the other two species evolved in Africa.The  Ancient Egyptian god of  embalming and  burial,  Anubis, was depicted as a man with a jackal's head. Today they are one of the more commonly seen animals on  safaris, and are found outside of  national parks and do well in human altered landscapes and even near and in human settlements.
