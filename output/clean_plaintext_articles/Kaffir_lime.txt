The Kaffir lime ( Citrus hystrix DC. , Rutaceae), also known as kieffer lime , is a Southeast Asian citrus plant with very aromatic leaves. The green lime fruits are distinguished by their bumpy exterior and their small size (approx. 4 cm wide), and the hourglass-shaped leaves (actually, the leaf and the leaf-shaped stem or phyllode) are widely used in Cambodian, Thai, and Lao Cuisine.
Kaffir lime leaves are also popular in the Cambodia , but less so in Vietnam . Malay, Burmese and Indonesian (especially, Balinese; see also Indonesian bay leaf) cuisines use them sporadically with chicken and fish .
The leaves can be used fresh or dried, and can be stored frozen.
Although the most common product of the kaffir lime tree is its leaves (which impart a sharp lime/ neroli flavour to Cambodian base paste known as "Krueng", Thai dishes such as tom yum, and to Indonesian food such as sayur assam - literally sour vegetables ), the juice and rinds of the small, dark green gnarled fruit (known as jeruk obat - literally medicine citrus ) are used in traditional Indonesian medicine.
As for the zest, it is widely used in creole cuisine and to impart flavor to "arranged" rums in the RÃ©union island and Madagascar .
