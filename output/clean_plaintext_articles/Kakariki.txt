The three species of Kākāriki or New Zealand parakeets are the most common  species of  parakeet in the  genus  Cyanoramphus,  family Psittacidae. The birds'  Māori name, which is the most commonly used, means "small parrot", and is also used as the term for the colour green.The three species on mainland New Zealand are the Yellow-crowned Parakeet Cyanoramphus auriceps, the Orange-fronted Parakeet C. malherbi and the Red-crowned Parakeet or Red-fronted Parakeet, C. novaezelandiae. All are native to New Zealand, and have become  endangered as a result of  habitat destruction following European settlement and nest predation by  introduced species of mammal. Scarce on the mainland, they have survived well on outlying islands, and also through breeding in captivity since they make good  pets. A licence from the  New Zealand Department of Conservation is now required to breed them in captivity.In October 2004, according to the  Porirua City News ( 17 November, page 8), two pairs of Red-crowned Parakeets were seen in the  Porirua Scenic Reserve, probably having flown from  Kapiti Island. Mitochondrial DNA analysis has indicated that the Orange-fronted Parakeet is a separate species and not just a colour variation of the Yellow-crowned Parakeet. The Orange-fronted Parakeet is highly endangered, with less than 200 individuals remaining in the North Canterbury region of the South Island. Furthermore, Chatham Island's Yellow-crowned Parakeet and the red-crowned populations of New Caledonia, Norfolk Island and the  subantarctic islands have been determined to be distinct species (Boon et al., 2001).There is one remaining subspecies of the Red-crowned Parakeet, the Chatham Island Red-crowned Parakeet, C. n. chathamensis, all other forms having been split off (see also Scofield, 2005). Aviculture
The red-crowned parakeets are common in aviculture and they are relatively easy to breed. They lay about 3 to 5 white eggs in a nesting box. A cinnamon colour variety and a pied variety are available. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81k%C4%81riki"
