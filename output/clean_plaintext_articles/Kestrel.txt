The name kestrel is given to several different members of the falcon genus, Falco. Kestrels are most easily distinguished by their typical hunting behaviour which is to hover at a height of around 10â€“20 m over open country and swoop down on prey, usually small mammals, lizards or large insects. Other falcons are more adapted to active hunting on the wing.Kestrels require a slight headwind in order to hover, hence a local name of windhover for  Common Kestrel. Their ability to spot prey is enhanced by being able to see ultraviolet which is strongly reflected by vole urine.Plumage typically differs between male and female, and (as is usual with  monogamous  raptors) the female is slightly larger than the male. This allows a pair to fill different feeding niches over their home range. Kestrels are bold and have adapted well to human encroachment, nesting in buildings and hunting by major roads.Kestrels do not build their own nests, but use nests built by other species.Bird species known by this name include:
The  Common Kestrel, found in Europe, Asia, and AfricaThe smaller  Lesser Kestrel, found in southern Europe, India, and Mediterranean AfricaThe  American Kestrel, found in North America and South AmericaThe  Fox Kestrel, found in Equatorial AfricaThe  Gray Kestrel, found in Central to Southern Africa Dickinson's Kestrel, found in Eastern to Southern AfricaThe  Greater Kestrel, found in Eastern to South AfricaThe  Madagascar KestrelThe  Banded Kestrel, found on MadagascarThe  Seychelles KestrelThe  Mauritius KestrelThe  Spotted Kestrel, found in IndonesiaThe  Nankeen Kestrel, found in Australia and  New Guinea
