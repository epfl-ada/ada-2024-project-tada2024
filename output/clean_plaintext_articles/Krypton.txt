Krypton ( IPA: /ˈkrɪptən/ or /ˈkrɪptan/ ) is a chemical element with the symbol Kr and atomic number 36. A colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, krypton occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere, is isolated by fractionating liquefied air, and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. Krypton is inert for most practical purposes but it is known to form compounds with fluorine . Krypton can also form clathrates with water when atoms of it are trapped in a lattice of the water molecules.
## Notable characteristics
Krypton, a noble gas due to its very low chemical reactivity, is characterized by a brilliant green and orange spectral signature. It is one of the products of uranium fission . Solidified krypton is white and crystalline with a face-centered cubic crystal structure which is a common property of all "rare gases".
## History
Krypton ( Greek κρυπτός meaning "hidden") was discovered in Great Britain, 1898 by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air.
#### Metric role
In 1960 an international agreement defined the metre in terms of light emitted from a krypton isotope. This agreement replaced the longstanding standard metre located in Paris which was a metal bar made of a platinum - iridium alloy (the bar was originally estimated to be one ten millionth of a quadrant of the earth 's polar circumference). But only 23 years later, the Krypton-based standard was replaced itself by the speed of light—the most reliable constant in the universe. In October 1983 the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) defined the metre as the distance that light travels in a vacuum during 1/299,792,458 s.
## Occurrence
The concentration of krypton in earth's atmosphere is about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation.
## Compounds
Like the other noble gases, krypton is widely considered to be chemically inert. Following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds in 1962, synthesis of krypton di fluoride was reported in 1963. Other fluorides and a salt of a krypton oxoacid have also been found. Ar Kr+ and Kr H + molecule- ions have been investigated and there is evidence for Kr Xe or KrXe+.
At the University of Helsinki in Finland, HKrCN and HKrCCH (krypton hydride-cyanide and hydrokryptoacetylene) were synthesized and determined to be stable up to 40 K(M. Räsänen et al.). See http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/noblegases.html in its paragraph starting " Many recent findings ".
## Isotopes
There are 32 known isotopes of krypton. Naturally occurring krypton is made of five stable and one slightly radioactive isotope. Krypton's spectral signature is easily produced with some very sharp lines. 81 Kr is the product of atmospheric reactions with the other naturally occurring isotopes of krypton. It is radioactive with a half-life of 250,000 years. Like xenon , krypton is highly volatile when it is near surface waters and 81 Kr has therefore been used for dating old (50,000 - 800,000 year) groundwater. 85 Kr is an inert radioactive noble gas with a half-life of 10.76 years, that is produced by fission of uranium and plutonium . Sources have included nuclear bomb testing, nuclear reactors, and the release of 85 Kr during the reprocessing of fuel rods from nuclear reactors. A strong gradient exists between the northern and southern hemispheres where concentrations at the North Pole are approximately 30% higher than the South Pole due to the fact that most 85 Kr is produced in the northern hemisphere, and north-south atmospheric mixing is relatively slow.
## Krypton fluoride laser
One major use of krypton is the krypton fluoride laser. Certain amounts of energy are added to force krypton gas to react with fluorine gas to become KrF excited state complex.
The compound will decompose once the energy supply stops. During the decomposition process, the excess energy stored in the excited state complex will be emitted in the form of strong ultraviolet laser radiation.
