Kuwait City (Arabic: مدينة الكويت,  transliteration: Madīnat al-Kūwait), is the capital city of Kuwait. It has an estimated population of 32,500 (2005 estimate) within city limits and 2.38 million in the  metropolitan area. Located at the heart of the country on the shore of the Persian Gulf, and containing Kuwait's parliament ( Majlis Al-Umma), most governmental offices, the headquarters of most Kuwaiti corporations and banks, it is the indisputable political, cultural and economical centre of the emirate.Kuwait City's trade and transportation needs are served by  Kuwait International Airport,  Mina Al-Shuwaik (Shuwaik Port) and  Mina al-Ahmadi (Ahmadi Port) 50 kilometers to the south, on the Persian Gulf coast.Kuwait City is located at 29°22'11" North, 47°58'42" East (29.369722, 47.978333) .


History
The city was invaded and seized by Iraqi forces in the  1990  Gulf War. Under Iraqi occupation it was renamed "Al Kadhima" (apparently an older name for the town1) in order to erase Kuwaiti identity. It returned to its original name once Iraqi troops were expelled.During the invasion, the city was extensively bombed and damaged. Buildings were fired upon, set alight, and demolished; roads and bridges links were the targets of explosives, and landmarks were defaced. The Kuwait National Museum, for example, which once held an extensive, comprehensive, and beautiful collection of artwork, was looted and then torched. The Kuwait Towers, the symbols of the country, were the targets of Saddam Hussein, who aimed to demolish them. Only minor damage was done to the Towers, and they are still the nation's symbol.After the invasion, foreign investors and the Kuwaiti government were actively involved in modernizing the city and transforming it into a world-class, state-of-the-art business hub. Today, virtually all traces of the invasion have been cleared, and construction cranes dot the skyline. Many new hotels, including an exclusive Four Seasons and InterContinental, are now under construction, indicating the recent economic growth spur. The city contains many new buildings and shopping malls with modern designs. Some tourists are already present in the city, most of them looking for a relaxing beach getaway.Suburbs
