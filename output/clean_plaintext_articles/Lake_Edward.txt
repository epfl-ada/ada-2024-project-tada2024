Lake Edward is one of the  Great Lakes of Africa. It is located in the Great Rift Valley, on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, its northern banks a few kilometers south of the  Equator. The lake was visited by Henry Morton Stanley in 1888 and was named by him in honour of Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales. The lake was later named Lake Idi Amin or Lake Idi Amin Dada after Ugandan dictator  Idi Amin, today it is again known as Lake Edward.

Lake Edward is fed by the  Nyamugasani, the  Ishasha, the  Rutshuru, and the  Rwindi rivers. It empties to the north via the  Semliki River into Lake Albert. It is also connected, by means of the  Kazinga Channel, to  Lake George to the northeast. It stands at an elevation of 920 metres, is 77 km long by 40 km wide at its maximum points, and covers a total surface area of 2,325 km² (the 15th largest on the continent). Ecology
Lake Edward is home to many species of fish, including populations of  Bagrus docmac,  Sarotherodon niloticus,  Sarotherodon leucostictus, and over 50 species of  Haplochromis and  Haplochromis related species, of which only 8 are formally described. Fishing is an important activity among local residents. Fauna living on the banks of the lake – including chimpanzees, elephants, crocodiles, and lions – are protected by the  Virunga National Park (Congo) and the  Queen Elizabeth National Park (Uganda). The area is also home to many perennial and migratory bird species.
