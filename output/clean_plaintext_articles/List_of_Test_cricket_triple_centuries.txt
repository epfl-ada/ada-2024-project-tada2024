This list of Test cricket triple centuries shows all instances where a batsman has scored 300 runs or more in a single innings in Test cricket, a feat achieved on 21 occasions by 19 different batsmen from six of the ten Test-cricket playing nations. No player from Bangladesh, New Zealand, South Africa or Zimbabwe has ever scored 300, although Martin Crowe of New Zealand was once dismissed for 299 in a match against Sri Lanka in 1991.
The first Test triple century was achieved by Andy Sandham of England against West Indies in 1930, and the most recent was scored by Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka against South Africa in 2006. The probability of a batsman scoring a Test triple century is comparable to that of a bowler taking a Test hat-trick.
Brian Lara of the West Indies and Donald Bradman of Australia are the only batsmen to reach 300 more than once. Bradman also scored 299 not out against South Africa in 1932. Lara's 400 not out against England in 2004, his second Test triple-century, is the highest score in Test cricket and the only instance of a Test quadruple century.
