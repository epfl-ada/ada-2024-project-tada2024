This is a list of U.S. states by date of statehood, that is, the date when each U.S. state joined the Union. Although the first 13 states can be considered to be members of the United States from the date of the  Declaration of Independence,  July 4,  1776, they are presented here as being "admitted" on the date each ratified the present United States Constitution; most other such lists, including the  50 State Quarters program, do the same. The admission dates for later states were set by either the act of admission or a later resolution issued under that act, except for  Ohio whose date of admission was determined by act of Congress in 1953 (see note below).The dates on this list do not account for the ostensible secession during the American Civil War of several states to form the  Confederate States of America, the subsequent restoration of those states to representation in Congress (sometimes called "readmission") between 1866 and 1870, or the end of  Reconstruction in those states. Nor do the dates on the list reflect ratification of the  Articles of Confederation, which is the original document naming the United States as such, and giving the initial label of "states" to the subnational political entities.
