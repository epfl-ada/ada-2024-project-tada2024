Animal welfare groups argue for greater protection for non-human animals, particularly those used by human beings in  laboratories or in entertainment, as well as  domestic animals such as those used for food, labour, or as companions ( pets).Unlike animal rights groups,  animal welfare groups do not argue that animals should never be used, or kept as property, by human beings. Nor do any animal welfare groups advocate violence. These groups tend to seek legal, social and financial strategies.The following is a list of animal welfare groups. For animal rights, see the  list of animal rights groups.
