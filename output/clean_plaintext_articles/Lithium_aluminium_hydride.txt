Lithium aluminium hydride (LiAl H4), commonly abbreviated to LAH, is a powerful  reducing agent used in  organic chemistry. It is more powerful than the related reducing agent  sodium borohydride due to the weaker Al-H bond compared to the B-H bond. It will convert  esters,  carboxylic acids and  ketones to alcohols; and  nitro compounds into  amines.LAH violently reacts with water, including atmospheric moisture, and the pure material is  pyrophoric. Commercial material is inhibited with mineral oil to allow handling in air.Pure, recrystallized (from diethyl ether) LAH is a white solid. Commercial samples are almost always grey due to trace contamination with aluminium metal. White air-exposed commercial samples of LAH have absorbed enough moisture to become a mixture of  lithium hydroxide and  aluminium hydroxide.
 Preparation
LAH is usually produced by the reaction between  lithium hydride (LiH) and aluminium chloride (AlCl3)
4LiH + AlCl3  LiAlH4 + 3LiCl

which proceeds with a high yield of LAH (97 % w/w). LiCl is removed by  filtration from an  ethereal solution of LAH, with subsequent precipitation of LAH to yield a product with around 1 % w/w LiCl. Inorganic reactions
LAH and  NaH can be used to produce sodium aluminium hydride (NaAlH4) by  metathesis in  THF with a yield of 90.7 % w/w
LiAlH4 + NaH  NaAlH4 + LiH

Potassium aluminium hydride (KAlH4) can be produced with a yield of 90 % w/w by reaction in  diglyme in a similar way
LiAlH4 + KH  KAlH4 + LiH

The reverse, i.e., production of LAH from either sodium aluminium hydride or potassium aluminium hydride can be obtained by reaction with LiCl in  diethyl ether and  THF with a yield of 93.5 and 91 % w/w, respectively.
NaAlH4 + LiCl  LiAlH4 + NaCl
KAlH4 + LiCl  LiAlH4 + KCl

Magnesium alanate (Mg(AlH4)2) can be synthezised from LAH and MgBr2
2LiAlH4 + MgBr2  Mg(AlH4)2 + 2LiBr
 Use in organic chemistry
Lithium aluminium hydride is widely used in organic chemistry as a very powerful  reducing agent. Despite handling problems associated with its reactivity, it is even used at the small-industrial scale, although for large scale reductions the related reagent sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride or Red-Al is more usual. For such purposes it is usually used in solution in  diethyl ether, and an  aqueous workup is usually performed after the reduction in order to remove inorganic by-products. It is most commonly used for the reduction of  esters   and  carboxylic acids  to primary alcohols; prior to the advent of LiAlH4 this was a difficult conversion involving sodium metal in boiling ethanol (the  Bouveault-Blanc reduction).  Aldehydes and  ketones  can also be reduced to alcohols by LAH, but this is usually done using milder reagents such as  NaBH4. α,β-Unsaturated ketones are reduced to allylic alcohols.  When  epoxides are reduced using LAH, the reagent attacks the less  hindered end of the epoxide, usually producing a secondary or tertiary alcohol. It reduces by progressive breakup of the complex AlH4− and transfer of hydride ions to the positive centre in an organic compound which may have a low density of electrons due to  inductive or  mesomeric effects. Amines can be prepared by the LAH reduction of  amides  ,  oximes ,  nitriles, nitro compounds or alkyl  azides. LAH is also able to reduce primary  alkyl halides to  alkanes.Lithium aluminium hydride is not able to reduce simple  alkenes or benzene rings, and  alkynes are only reduced if an alcohol group is nearby.  Thermal decomposition
At room temperature LAH is  metastable. During prolonged storage it may slowly decompose to Li3AlH6 and LiH. This process can be accelerated by the presence of  catalytic elements e.g. Ti, Fe, V.When heated LAH decompose in a three step  reaction mechanism.

LiAlH4  1/3Li3AlH6 + 2/3Al + H2 (R1)
1/3Li3AlH6  LiH + 1/3Al + 1/2H2 (R2)
LiH + Al  LiAl + 1/2H2 (R3)
R1 is usually initiated by the  melting of LAH around a temperature of 150-170oC immediately followed by decomposition into solid Li3AlH6. From 200-250oC Li3AlH6 decompose into LiH (R2) which subsequently decompose into LiAl above 400oC (R3). R1 is effectively irreversible, because LiAlH4 is metastable. The reversibility of R2 has not yet been conclusively established. R3 is reversible with an equilibrium pressure of about 0.25 bar at 500oC. R1 and R2 can occur at room temperature with suitable catalysts.According to reactions R1-R3 LiAlH4 contains 10.6 wt % hydrogen thereby making LAH a potential hydrogen storage medium for future  fuel cell powered  vehicles. Cycling only R2 would store 5.6 wt % in the material in a single step (comparable to the two steps of NaAlH4). Solubility data
LAH is soluble in many  etheral solutions. However, it may spontaneously decompose due to the presence of catalytic impurities, though, it appears to be more stable in  THF. Thus,  THF is preferred over e.g.  diethyl ether even despite the lower solubility.

LAH is usually produced by the reaction between  lithium hydride (LiH) and aluminium chloride (AlCl3)
4LiH + AlCl3  LiAlH4 + 3LiCl

which proceeds with a high yield of LAH (97 % w/w). LiCl is removed by  filtration from an  ethereal solution of LAH, with subsequent precipitation of LAH to yield a product with around 1 % w/w LiCl. Inorganic reactions
LAH and  NaH can be used to produce sodium aluminium hydride (NaAlH4) by  metathesis in  THF with a yield of 90.7 % w/w
LiAlH4 + NaH  NaAlH4 + LiH

Potassium aluminium hydride (KAlH4) can be produced with a yield of 90 % w/w by reaction in  diglyme in a similar way
LiAlH4 + KH  KAlH4 + LiH

The reverse, i.e., production of LAH from either sodium aluminium hydride or potassium aluminium hydride can be obtained by reaction with LiCl in  diethyl ether and  THF with a yield of 93.5 and 91 % w/w, respectively.
NaAlH4 + LiCl  LiAlH4 + NaCl
KAlH4 + LiCl  LiAlH4 + KCl

Magnesium alanate (Mg(AlH4)2) can be synthezised from LAH and MgBr2
2LiAlH4 + MgBr2  Mg(AlH4)2 + 2LiBr
 Use in organic chemistry
Lithium aluminium hydride is widely used in organic chemistry as a very powerful  reducing agent. Despite handling problems associated with its reactivity, it is even used at the small-industrial scale, although for large scale reductions the related reagent sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride or Red-Al is more usual. For such purposes it is usually used in solution in  diethyl ether, and an  aqueous workup is usually performed after the reduction in order to remove inorganic by-products. It is most commonly used for the reduction of  esters   and  carboxylic acids  to primary alcohols; prior to the advent of LiAlH4 this was a difficult conversion involving sodium metal in boiling ethanol (the  Bouveault-Blanc reduction).  Aldehydes and  ketones  can also be reduced to alcohols by LAH, but this is usually done using milder reagents such as  NaBH4. α,β-Unsaturated ketones are reduced to allylic alcohols.  When  epoxides are reduced using LAH, the reagent attacks the less  hindered end of the epoxide, usually producing a secondary or tertiary alcohol. It reduces by progressive breakup of the complex AlH4− and transfer of hydride ions to the positive centre in an organic compound which may have a low density of electrons due to  inductive or  mesomeric effects. Amines can be prepared by the LAH reduction of  amides  ,  oximes ,  nitriles, nitro compounds or alkyl  azides. LAH is also able to reduce primary  alkyl halides to  alkanes.Lithium aluminium hydride is not able to reduce simple  alkenes or benzene rings, and  alkynes are only reduced if an alcohol group is nearby.  Thermal decomposition
At room temperature LAH is  metastable. During prolonged storage it may slowly decompose to Li3AlH6 and LiH. This process can be accelerated by the presence of  catalytic elements e.g. Ti, Fe, V.When heated LAH decompose in a three step  reaction mechanism.

LiAlH4  1/3Li3AlH6 + 2/3Al + H2 (R1)
1/3Li3AlH6  LiH + 1/3Al + 1/2H2 (R2)
LiH + Al  LiAl + 1/2H2 (R3)
R1 is usually initiated by the  melting of LAH around a temperature of 150-170oC immediately followed by decomposition into solid Li3AlH6. From 200-250oC Li3AlH6 decompose into LiH (R2) which subsequently decompose into LiAl above 400oC (R3). R1 is effectively irreversible, because LiAlH4 is metastable. The reversibility of R2 has not yet been conclusively established. R3 is reversible with an equilibrium pressure of about 0.25 bar at 500oC. R1 and R2 can occur at room temperature with suitable catalysts.According to reactions R1-R3 LiAlH4 contains 10.6 wt % hydrogen thereby making LAH a potential hydrogen storage medium for future  fuel cell powered  vehicles. Cycling only R2 would store 5.6 wt % in the material in a single step (comparable to the two steps of NaAlH4). Solubility data
LAH is soluble in many  etheral solutions. However, it may spontaneously decompose due to the presence of catalytic impurities, though, it appears to be more stable in  THF. Thus,  THF is preferred over e.g.  diethyl ether even despite the lower solubility.

Potassium aluminium hydride (KAlH4) can be produced with a yield of 90 % w/w by reaction in  diglyme in a similar way
LiAlH4 + KH  KAlH4 + LiH

The reverse, i.e., production of LAH from either sodium aluminium hydride or potassium aluminium hydride can be obtained by reaction with LiCl in  diethyl ether and  THF with a yield of 93.5 and 91 % w/w, respectively.
NaAlH4 + LiCl  LiAlH4 + NaCl
KAlH4 + LiCl  LiAlH4 + KCl

Magnesium alanate (Mg(AlH4)2) can be synthezised from LAH and MgBr2

 Use in organic chemistry
Lithium aluminium hydride is widely used in organic chemistry as a very powerful  reducing agent. Despite handling problems associated with its reactivity, it is even used at the small-industrial scale, although for large scale reductions the related reagent sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride or Red-Al is more usual. For such purposes it is usually used in solution in  diethyl ether, and an  aqueous workup is usually performed after the reduction in order to remove inorganic by-products. It is most commonly used for the reduction of  esters   and  carboxylic acids  to primary alcohols; prior to the advent of LiAlH4 this was a difficult conversion involving sodium metal in boiling ethanol (the  Bouveault-Blanc reduction).  Aldehydes and  ketones  can also be reduced to alcohols by LAH, but this is usually done using milder reagents such as  NaBH4. α,β-Unsaturated ketones are reduced to allylic alcohols.  When  epoxides are reduced using LAH, the reagent attacks the less  hindered end of the epoxide, usually producing a secondary or tertiary alcohol. It reduces by progressive breakup of the complex AlH4− and transfer of hydride ions to the positive centre in an organic compound which may have a low density of electrons due to  inductive or  mesomeric effects. Amines can be prepared by the LAH reduction of  amides  ,  oximes ,  nitriles, nitro compounds or alkyl  azides. LAH is also able to reduce primary  alkyl halides to  alkanes.Lithium aluminium hydride is not able to reduce simple  alkenes or benzene rings, and  alkynes are only reduced if an alcohol group is nearby.  Thermal decomposition
At room temperature LAH is  metastable. During prolonged storage it may slowly decompose to Li3AlH6 and LiH. This process can be accelerated by the presence of  catalytic elements e.g. Ti, Fe, V.When heated LAH decompose in a three step  reaction mechanism.

LiAlH4  1/3Li3AlH6 + 2/3Al + H2 (R1)
1/3Li3AlH6  LiH + 1/3Al + 1/2H2 (R2)
LiH + Al  LiAl + 1/2H2 (R3)
R1 is usually initiated by the  melting of LAH around a temperature of 150-170oC immediately followed by decomposition into solid Li3AlH6. From 200-250oC Li3AlH6 decompose into LiH (R2) which subsequently decompose into LiAl above 400oC (R3). R1 is effectively irreversible, because LiAlH4 is metastable. The reversibility of R2 has not yet been conclusively established. R3 is reversible with an equilibrium pressure of about 0.25 bar at 500oC. R1 and R2 can occur at room temperature with suitable catalysts.According to reactions R1-R3 LiAlH4 contains 10.6 wt % hydrogen thereby making LAH a potential hydrogen storage medium for future  fuel cell powered  vehicles. Cycling only R2 would store 5.6 wt % in the material in a single step (comparable to the two steps of NaAlH4). Solubility data
LAH is soluble in many  etheral solutions. However, it may spontaneously decompose due to the presence of catalytic impurities, though, it appears to be more stable in  THF. Thus,  THF is preferred over e.g.  diethyl ether even despite the lower solubility.

When  epoxides are reduced using LAH, the reagent attacks the less  hindered end of the epoxide, usually producing a secondary or tertiary alcohol. It reduces by progressive breakup of the complex AlH4− and transfer of hydride ions to the positive centre in an organic compound which may have a low density of electrons due to  inductive or  mesomeric effects. Amines can be prepared by the LAH reduction of  amides  ,  oximes ,  nitriles, nitro compounds or alkyl  azides. LAH is also able to reduce primary  alkyl halides to  alkanes.Lithium aluminium hydride is not able to reduce simple  alkenes or benzene rings, and  alkynes are only reduced if an alcohol group is nearby.  Thermal decomposition
At room temperature LAH is  metastable. During prolonged storage it may slowly decompose to Li3AlH6 and LiH. This process can be accelerated by the presence of  catalytic elements e.g. Ti, Fe, V.When heated LAH decompose in a three step  reaction mechanism.

LiAlH4  1/3Li3AlH6 + 2/3Al + H2 (R1)
1/3Li3AlH6  LiH + 1/3Al + 1/2H2 (R2)
LiH + Al  LiAl + 1/2H2 (R3)
R1 is usually initiated by the  melting of LAH around a temperature of 150-170oC immediately followed by decomposition into solid Li3AlH6. From 200-250oC Li3AlH6 decompose into LiH (R2) which subsequently decompose into LiAl above 400oC (R3). R1 is effectively irreversible, because LiAlH4 is metastable. The reversibility of R2 has not yet been conclusively established. R3 is reversible with an equilibrium pressure of about 0.25 bar at 500oC. R1 and R2 can occur at room temperature with suitable catalysts.According to reactions R1-R3 LiAlH4 contains 10.6 wt % hydrogen thereby making LAH a potential hydrogen storage medium for future  fuel cell powered  vehicles. Cycling only R2 would store 5.6 wt % in the material in a single step (comparable to the two steps of NaAlH4). Solubility data
LAH is soluble in many  etheral solutions. However, it may spontaneously decompose due to the presence of catalytic impurities, though, it appears to be more stable in  THF. Thus,  THF is preferred over e.g.  diethyl ether even despite the lower solubility.

When heated LAH decompose in a three step  reaction mechanism.

LiAlH4  1/3Li3AlH6 + 2/3Al + H2 (R1)
1/3Li3AlH6  LiH + 1/3Al + 1/2H2 (R2)
LiH + Al  LiAl + 1/2H2 (R3)
R1 is usually initiated by the  melting of LAH around a temperature of 150-170oC immediately followed by decomposition into solid Li3AlH6. From 200-250oC Li3AlH6 decompose into LiH (R2) which subsequently decompose into LiAl above 400oC (R3). R1 is effectively irreversible, because LiAlH4 is metastable. The reversibility of R2 has not yet been conclusively established. R3 is reversible with an equilibrium pressure of about 0.25 bar at 500oC. R1 and R2 can occur at room temperature with suitable catalysts.According to reactions R1-R3 LiAlH4 contains 10.6 wt % hydrogen thereby making LAH a potential hydrogen storage medium for future  fuel cell powered  vehicles. Cycling only R2 would store 5.6 wt % in the material in a single step (comparable to the two steps of NaAlH4). Solubility data
LAH is soluble in many  etheral solutions. However, it may spontaneously decompose due to the presence of catalytic impurities, though, it appears to be more stable in  THF. Thus,  THF is preferred over e.g.  diethyl ether even despite the lower solubility.
