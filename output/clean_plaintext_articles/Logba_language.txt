Logba is a  Kwa language spoken in the south-eastern Ghana by approximately 7 500 people. The  Logba people call themselves and their language Ikpana, which means ‘defenders of truth’. Logba is different from  Lukpa of Togo and Benin, which is also sometimes referred to as Logba.
 Classification
The first published treatment of Logba was a short grammar by  Diedrich Hermann Westermann (1903). Westermann included Logba in his group of Togo Restsprachen (Togo Remnant languages), a terminology adopted by several subsequent researchers . Dakubu and Ford (1988) renamed this cluster the Central Togo languages but since Ring (1995) they are commonly referred to as  Ghana Togo Mountain languages. The about fourteen Ghana Togo Mountain languages are part of the  Kwa branch of the  Niger-Congo phylum. Geography and demography


 A girl sells produce in Logba


The Logba people live in the  Volta Region of Ghana, east of the  Volta Lake in the mountains of the Ghana-Togo borderland. Most Logba towns and villages are situated along the trunk road from Accra to Hohoe. They include the following settlements: Wuinta, Akusame, Adiveme, Andokɔfe, Adzakoe, Alakpeti, Klikpo, and Tota. Tota is located high in the Ghana Togo Mountains to the east of the Accra-Hohoe road. Alikpeti is the commercial centre of Logba, while Klikpo is traditionally the seat of the head of the Logba people. The Logba people are peasant farmers, producing cassava, maize, yams, and cahs crops like cocoa and coffee. The Logba area is known for its  limestone formations, including underground caves with  stalagmites and  stalactites.The dominant language in the regio is  Ewe, closely followed by  Twi. Most Logba people are bilingual in Ewe. South of the Logba area live the Avatime people. Logba is only distantly related to its direct neighbours  Avatime and Nyagbo-Tafi; according to  Bernd Heine (1968) it is more closely related to the Akpafu and Santrokofi languages spoken northwards.It is generally agreed that the Logba people are not the original inhabitants of the area they now reside in. There have been two hypotheses as to the origin of the Logba people. Heine (1968, following Debrunner), proposed that the Logba are descendants from the makɔ́ people, having fled south after a defeat in the second half of the 18th century. However, the Logba people themselves relate that they have come together with the Gbe peoples from  Ketu . The latter view is advanced also by Dorvlo (2004). Linguistic features
Logba has a nine vowel system with  ATR  vowel harmony. Vowel harmony in Logba is root-controlled, which means that the vowels of its nominal prefixes harmonize with the vowels of the root. Vowels are nasalized when they occur in the immediate environment of a nasal consonant.

Logba has a total of 23  consonants. A notable feature of Logba phonology is the opposition between bilabial and labio-dental fricatives, found in various other languages of the region, including  Ewe. Logba is a  tonal language with two level tones: High and Low. These tones can be combined on one syllable, yielding a Rising or Falling contour tone.All  syllables are open in Logba. Every syllable bears a tone. The basic syllable structure can be rendered as (C1)(C2)V+T, where C = consonant, V = vowel or syllabic nasal, and T = tone. Dorvlo (2004) distinguishes three types of syllables:
 Nucleus only, comprised of a vowel or a  syllabic nasal. This type is found only in pronouns and nominal prefixes. Examples: ɛ́-mɔ́ 'they laughed'; ɔ́-zɔ́ 'he/she went'; n-dà 'liquor'. Onset and nucleus. This is the most common syllabe type in Logba; most words are of this form. In multisyllabic words, it can occur in all positions. Examples: bà ‘come’; gbà  ‘sweep’; bìsí ‘cola nut’Complex onset and nucleus. Only /r/ and /l/ occur as the second consonant of the complex onset. This syllable type can also form a word by itself. In multisyllabic words, in can occur in all positions. Examples: à-klɔ́   ‘goat’; trò ‘refuse’; ìvàflí   ‘(thing) white’.
