The Mediterranean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Europe, on the south by Africa, and on the east by Asia. It covers an approximate area of  2.5 million  km² (965 000  mi²), but its connection to the Atlantic (the  Strait of Gibraltar) is only 14 km (9 mi) wide. In oceanography, it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea, to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere.It was a superhighway of transport in ancient times, allowing for trade and cultural exchange between emergent peoples of the region — the Mesopotamian, Egyptian,  Semitic, Persian,  Phoenician,  Carthaginian, Greek, Roman and Turkish cultures. The  history of the Mediterranean is important in understanding the origin and development of  Western Civilization.
 Name
The term Mediterranean derives from the Latin mediterraneus, 'inland' (medius, 'middle' + terra, 'land, earth'), in  Greek "mesogeios".The Mediterranean Sea has been known by a number of alternative names throughout human history. It was, for example, commonly called  Mare Nostrum (Latin, Our Sea), and occasionally Mare Internum by the Romans. ( Sallust, Jug. 17). In the  Old Testament, on the west coast of the  Holy Land, and therefore behind a person facing the east, it is called the "Hinder Sea", sometimes translated as "Western Sea", ( Deut. xi. 24;  Joel, ii. 20), and also the "Sea of the Philistines" ( Exod. xxii. 81), because that people occupied a large portion of its shores near the  Israelites. Mostly, however, it was the "Great Sea" ( Num. xxxiv. 6, 7;  Josh. i. 4, ix. 1, xv. 47;  Ezek. xlvii. 10, 15, 20), or simply "The Sea" ( 1 Kings, v. 9; comp.  1 Macc. xiv. 34. xv. 11). In Hebrew, it is called "ha-Yam ha-Tikhon" (הַיָּם הַתִּיכוֹן), "the middle sea", a literal adaptation of the German equivalent Mittelmeer. In  Turkish, it is Akdeniz, "the white sea". In Arabic, it is Al-Baħr Al-Abyad Al-Muttawasit (البحر الأبيض المتوسط), "the middle white sea".Most languages word for the Mediterranean Sea have a name for the sea, often a translation of either "middle sea" or "white sea", including:

 Geography and Climate



The Mediterranean Sea is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the  Strait of Gibraltar on the west and to the  Sea of Marmara and Black Sea, by the  Dardanelles and the  Bosporus respectively, on the east. The Sea of Marmara is often considered a part of the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the Black Sea is generally not. The man-made Suez Canal in the south-east connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea.Large  islands in the Mediterranean include Cyprus,  Crete,  Euboea,  Rhodes,  Lesbos,  Chios,  Kefalonia and  Corfu in the eastern Mediterranean;  Sardinia,  Corsica,  Sicily, and Malta in the central Mediterranean; and  Ibiza,  Majorca and  Minorca (the  Balearic Islands) in the western Mediterranean.The  Mediterranean climate is generally one of wet winters and hot, dry summers. Crops of the region include  olives,  grapes,  oranges,  tangerines, and  cork. Oceanography
Being nearly landlocked affects the Mediterranean Sea's properties; for instance, tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the Atlantic ocean. The Mediterranean is characterized and immediately recognized by its imposing deep blue colour, especially around Greek islands. Evaporation greatly exceeds  precipitation and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin. Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and  salinity to increase eastward. This  pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin; it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east, then sinks in the region of the  Levant and circulates westward, to spill over the Strait of Gibraltar. Thus, seawater flow is eastward in the Strait's surface waters, and westward below; once in the open ocean, this chemically-distinct Mediterranean Intermediate Water can persist thousands of kilometers away from its source.

The Mediterranean Sea is sub-divided into a number of smaller seas, each with their own designation (from west to east):
the  Alboran Sea, between Spain and Morocco,the  Balearic Sea, between mainland Spain and its  Balearic Islands,the  Ligurian Sea between  Corsica and  Liguria (Italy),the  Tyrrhenian Sea enclosed by  Sardinia,  Italian peninsula and  Sicily,the  Adriatic Sea between the Italian peninsula and the coasts of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Albaniathe  Ionian Sea between Italy, Greece, and Albania,the  Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey, with

the  Libyan Sea south of  Crete, between the island and Libyathe  Sea of Marmara between the  Aegean and Black Seas.the  Cilician Sea between Turkey and Cyprus
Many of these smaller seas feature in local myth and folklore and derive their names from these associations. In addition to the seas, a number of  gulfs and  straits are also recognised:
the  Gulf of Corinth, an enclosed sea between the Ionian Sea and the  Corinth Canalthe  Saronic Gulf, the gulf of Athens, between the Corinth Canal and the  Mirtoan Seathe  Thermaic Gulf, the gulf of  Thessaloniki, located in the northern Greek region of  Macedoniathe  Gulf of Lion, south of Francethe  Strait of Messina, between  Sicily and the toe of Italythe  Gulf of Taranto, southern Italy,the  Strait of Otranto, between Italy and Albaniathe  Gulf of Haifa, between  Haifa and  Akko, Israelthe  Gulf of Sidra, between Tunisia and  Cyrenaica (eastern Libya)the  Strait of Sicily, between  Sicily and Tunisiathe  Corsica Channel, between  Corsica and Italythe  Strait of Bonifacio, between  Sardinia and  Corsicathe  Gulf of İskenderun, between  İskenderun and  Adana (Turkey)the  Gulf of Antalya, between west and east shores of Antalya (Turkey)
 Geology
The geology of the Mediterranean is complex, involving the break-up and then collision of the African and Eurasian plates, and the  Messinian Salinity Crisis in the late Miocene when the Mediterranean dried up.The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500  m and the deepest recorded point is 5267 meters (about 3.27 miles) in the  Calypso Deep in the  Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000  km. A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of  Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions (which in turn are divided into subdivisions), the Western Mediterranean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million  km² and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million  km².In the last few centuries, mankind has done much to alter Mediterranean geology. Structures have been built all along the coastlines, exacerbating and rerouting erosional patterns. Many pollution-producing boats travel the sea that unbalance the natural chemical ratios of the region. Beaches have been mismanaged, and the overuse of the sea's natural and marine resources continues to be a problem. This misuse speeds along and/or confounds natural processes. The actual geography has also been altered by the building of dams and canals.The Mediterranean was once thought to be the remnant of the  Tethys Ocean. It is now known to be a structurally younger ocean basin known as Neotethys. Neotethys formed during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic  rifting of the African and Eurasian plates. Ecology
As a result of the drying of the sea during the  Messinian Salinity Crisis, the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and Red seas. The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a  tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The  Bitter Lakes, which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. The construction of the  Aswan High Dam across the  Nile River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the eastern Mediterranean, which has made conditions there even more like the Red Sea. This species exchange is known as the  Lessepsian Migration, after  Ferdinand de Lesseps, the engineer who oversaw the canal's construction.

The term Mediterranean derives from the Latin mediterraneus, 'inland' (medius, 'middle' + terra, 'land, earth'), in  Greek "mesogeios".The Mediterranean Sea has been known by a number of alternative names throughout human history. It was, for example, commonly called  Mare Nostrum (Latin, Our Sea), and occasionally Mare Internum by the Romans. ( Sallust, Jug. 17). In the  Old Testament, on the west coast of the  Holy Land, and therefore behind a person facing the east, it is called the "Hinder Sea", sometimes translated as "Western Sea", ( Deut. xi. 24;  Joel, ii. 20), and also the "Sea of the Philistines" ( Exod. xxii. 81), because that people occupied a large portion of its shores near the  Israelites. Mostly, however, it was the "Great Sea" ( Num. xxxiv. 6, 7;  Josh. i. 4, ix. 1, xv. 47;  Ezek. xlvii. 10, 15, 20), or simply "The Sea" ( 1 Kings, v. 9; comp.  1 Macc. xiv. 34. xv. 11). In Hebrew, it is called "ha-Yam ha-Tikhon" (הַיָּם הַתִּיכוֹן), "the middle sea", a literal adaptation of the German equivalent Mittelmeer. In  Turkish, it is Akdeniz, "the white sea". In Arabic, it is Al-Baħr Al-Abyad Al-Muttawasit (البحر الأبيض المتوسط), "the middle white sea".Most languages word for the Mediterranean Sea have a name for the sea, often a translation of either "middle sea" or "white sea", including:

 Geography and Climate



The Mediterranean Sea is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the  Strait of Gibraltar on the west and to the  Sea of Marmara and Black Sea, by the  Dardanelles and the  Bosporus respectively, on the east. The Sea of Marmara is often considered a part of the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the Black Sea is generally not. The man-made Suez Canal in the south-east connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea.Large  islands in the Mediterranean include Cyprus,  Crete,  Euboea,  Rhodes,  Lesbos,  Chios,  Kefalonia and  Corfu in the eastern Mediterranean;  Sardinia,  Corsica,  Sicily, and Malta in the central Mediterranean; and  Ibiza,  Majorca and  Minorca (the  Balearic Islands) in the western Mediterranean.The  Mediterranean climate is generally one of wet winters and hot, dry summers. Crops of the region include  olives,  grapes,  oranges,  tangerines, and  cork. Oceanography
Being nearly landlocked affects the Mediterranean Sea's properties; for instance, tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the Atlantic ocean. The Mediterranean is characterized and immediately recognized by its imposing deep blue colour, especially around Greek islands. Evaporation greatly exceeds  precipitation and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin. Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and  salinity to increase eastward. This  pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin; it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east, then sinks in the region of the  Levant and circulates westward, to spill over the Strait of Gibraltar. Thus, seawater flow is eastward in the Strait's surface waters, and westward below; once in the open ocean, this chemically-distinct Mediterranean Intermediate Water can persist thousands of kilometers away from its source.

 Geology
The geology of the Mediterranean is complex, involving the break-up and then collision of the African and Eurasian plates, and the  Messinian Salinity Crisis in the late Miocene when the Mediterranean dried up.The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500  m and the deepest recorded point is 5267 meters (about 3.27 miles) in the  Calypso Deep in the  Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000  km. A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of  Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions (which in turn are divided into subdivisions), the Western Mediterranean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million  km² and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million  km².In the last few centuries, mankind has done much to alter Mediterranean geology. Structures have been built all along the coastlines, exacerbating and rerouting erosional patterns. Many pollution-producing boats travel the sea that unbalance the natural chemical ratios of the region. Beaches have been mismanaged, and the overuse of the sea's natural and marine resources continues to be a problem. This misuse speeds along and/or confounds natural processes.

The Sea of Marmara is often considered a part of the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the Black Sea is generally not. The man-made Suez Canal in the south-east connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea.Large  islands in the Mediterranean include Cyprus,  Crete,  Euboea,  Rhodes,  Lesbos,  Chios,  Kefalonia and  Corfu in the eastern Mediterranean;  Sardinia,  Corsica,  Sicily, and Malta in the central Mediterranean; and  Ibiza,  Majorca and  Minorca (the  Balearic Islands) in the western Mediterranean.The  Mediterranean climate is generally one of wet winters and hot, dry summers.

 Geology
The geology of the Mediterranean is complex, involving the break-up and then collision of the African and Eurasian plates, and the  Messinian Salinity Crisis in the late Miocene when the Mediterranean dried up.The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500  m and the deepest recorded point is 5267 meters (about 3.27 miles) in the  Calypso Deep in the  Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000  km. A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of  Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions (which in turn are divided into subdivisions), the Western Mediterranean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million  km² and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million  km².In the last few centuries, mankind has done much to alter Mediterranean geology. Structures have been built all along the coastlines, exacerbating and rerouting erosional patterns. Many pollution-producing boats travel the sea that unbalance the natural chemical ratios of the region. Beaches have been mismanaged, and the overuse of the sea's natural and marine resources continues to be a problem. This misuse speeds along and/or confounds natural processes. The actual geography has also been altered by the building of dams and canals.The Mediterranean was once thought to be the remnant of the  Tethys Ocean. It is now known to be a structurally younger ocean basin known as Neotethys. Neotethys formed during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic  rifting of the African and Eurasian plates. Ecology
As a result of the drying of the sea during the  Messinian Salinity Crisis, the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and Red seas. The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a  tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The  Bitter Lakes, which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. The construction of the  Aswan High Dam across the  Nile River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the eastern Mediterranean, which has made conditions there even more like the Red Sea.

Currently, "The Med" is a common British English contraction for the Mediterranean Sea and its surrounding regions when employed in informal speech. "The Med" (and more often "the Eastern Med" or "the Western Med") are almost to the exclusion of other terms in informal usage in the US Navy. History



 Geography and Climate



The Mediterranean Sea is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the  Strait of Gibraltar on the west and to the  Sea of Marmara and Black Sea, by the  Dardanelles and the  Bosporus respectively, on the east. The Sea of Marmara is often considered a part of the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the Black Sea is generally not. The man-made Suez Canal in the south-east connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea.Large  islands in the Mediterranean include Cyprus,  Crete,  Euboea,  Rhodes,  Lesbos,  Chios,  Kefalonia and  Corfu in the eastern Mediterranean;  Sardinia,  Corsica,  Sicily, and Malta in the central Mediterranean; and  Ibiza,  Majorca and  Minorca (the  Balearic Islands) in the western Mediterranean.The  Mediterranean climate is generally one of wet winters and hot, dry summers. Crops of the region include  olives,  grapes,  oranges,  tangerines, and  cork. Oceanography
Being nearly landlocked affects the Mediterranean Sea's properties; for instance, tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the Atlantic ocean. The Mediterranean is characterized and immediately recognized by its imposing deep blue colour, especially around Greek islands. Evaporation greatly exceeds  precipitation and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin. Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and  salinity to increase eastward. This  pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin; it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east, then sinks in the region of the  Levant and circulates westward, to spill over the Strait of Gibraltar. Thus, seawater flow is eastward in the Strait's surface waters, and westward below; once in the open ocean, this chemically-distinct Mediterranean Intermediate Water can persist thousands of kilometers away from its source.

 Geology
The geology of the Mediterranean is complex, involving the break-up and then collision of the African and Eurasian plates, and the  Messinian Salinity Crisis in the late Miocene when the Mediterranean dried up.The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500  m and the deepest recorded point is 5267 meters (about 3.27 miles) in the  Calypso Deep in the  Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000  km. A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of  Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions (which in turn are divided into subdivisions), the Western Mediterranean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million  km² and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million  km².In the last few centuries, mankind has done much to alter Mediterranean geology. Structures have been built all along the coastlines, exacerbating and rerouting erosional patterns. Many pollution-producing boats travel the sea that unbalance the natural chemical ratios of the region. Beaches have been mismanaged, and the overuse of the sea's natural and marine resources continues to be a problem. This misuse speeds along and/or confounds natural processes. The actual geography has also been altered by the building of dams and canals.The Mediterranean was once thought to be the remnant of the  Tethys Ocean. It is now known to be a structurally younger ocean basin known as Neotethys. Neotethys formed during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic  rifting of the African and Eurasian plates. Ecology
As a result of the drying of the sea during the  Messinian Salinity Crisis, the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and Red seas. The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a  tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The  Bitter Lakes, which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. The construction of the  Aswan High Dam across the  Nile River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the eastern Mediterranean, which has made conditions there even more like the Red Sea.

The Mediterranean Sea is sub-divided into a number of smaller seas, each with their own designation (from west to east):
the  Alboran Sea, between Spain and Morocco,the  Balearic Sea, between mainland Spain and its  Balearic Islands,the  Ligurian Sea between  Corsica and  Liguria (Italy),the  Tyrrhenian Sea enclosed by  Sardinia,  Italian peninsula and  Sicily,the  Adriatic Sea between the Italian peninsula and the coasts of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Albaniathe  Ionian Sea between Italy, Greece, and Albania,the  Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey, with 
the  Thracian Sea in its north,the  Myrtoan Sea between the  Cyclades and the  Peloponnesos,the  Sea of Crete north of Crete, and
the  Libyan Sea south of  Crete, between the island and Libyathe  Sea of Marmara between the  Aegean and Black Seas.the  Cilician Sea between Turkey and Cyprus
Many of these smaller seas feature in local myth and folklore and derive their names from these associations. In addition to the seas, a number of  gulfs and  straits are also recognised:
the  Gulf of Corinth, an enclosed sea between the Ionian Sea and the  Corinth Canalthe  Saronic Gulf, the gulf of Athens, between the Corinth Canal and the  Mirtoan Seathe  Thermaic Gulf, the gulf of  Thessaloniki, located in the northern Greek region of  Macedoniathe  Gulf of Lion, south of Francethe  Strait of Messina, between  Sicily and the toe of Italythe  Gulf of Taranto, southern Italy,the  Strait of Otranto, between Italy and Albaniathe  Gulf of Haifa, between  Haifa and  Akko, Israelthe  Gulf of Sidra, between Tunisia and  Cyrenaica (eastern Libya)the  Strait of Sicily, between  Sicily and Tunisiathe  Corsica Channel, between  Corsica and Italythe  Strait of Bonifacio, between  Sardinia and  Corsicathe  Gulf of İskenderun, between  İskenderun and  Adana (Turkey)the  Gulf of Antalya, between west and east shores of Antalya (Turkey)
 Geology
The geology of the Mediterranean is complex, involving the break-up and then collision of the African and Eurasian plates, and the  Messinian Salinity Crisis in the late Miocene when the Mediterranean dried up.The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500  m and the deepest recorded point is 5267 meters (about 3.27 miles) in the  Calypso Deep in the  Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000  km. A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of  Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions (which in turn are divided into subdivisions), the Western Mediterranean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million  km² and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million  km².In the last few centuries, mankind has done much to alter Mediterranean geology. Structures have been built all along the coastlines, exacerbating and rerouting erosional patterns. Many pollution-producing boats travel the sea that unbalance the natural chemical ratios of the region. Beaches have been mismanaged, and the overuse of the sea's natural and marine resources continues to be a problem. This misuse speeds along and/or confounds natural processes. The actual geography has also been altered by the building of dams and canals.The Mediterranean was once thought to be the remnant of the  Tethys Ocean. It is now known to be a structurally younger ocean basin known as Neotethys. Neotethys formed during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic  rifting of the African and Eurasian plates. Ecology
As a result of the drying of the sea during the  Messinian Salinity Crisis, the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and Red seas. The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a  tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The  Bitter Lakes, which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. The construction of the  Aswan High Dam across the  Nile River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the eastern Mediterranean, which has made conditions there even more like the Red Sea. This species exchange is known as the  Lessepsian Migration, after  Ferdinand de Lesseps, the engineer who oversaw the canal's construction.

The  Mediterranean climate is generally one of wet winters and hot, dry summers. Crops of the region include  olives,  grapes,  oranges,  tangerines, and  cork. Oceanography
Being nearly landlocked affects the Mediterranean Sea's properties; for instance, tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the Atlantic ocean. The Mediterranean is characterized and immediately recognized by its imposing deep blue colour, especially around Greek islands. Evaporation greatly exceeds  precipitation and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin. Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and  salinity to increase eastward. This  pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin; it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east, then sinks in the region of the  Levant and circulates westward, to spill over the Strait of Gibraltar. Thus, seawater flow is eastward in the Strait's surface waters, and westward below; once in the open ocean, this chemically-distinct Mediterranean Intermediate Water can persist thousands of kilometers away from its source.

Europe (from west to east): Spain, France, Monaco, Italy, the island state of Malta, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Turkey, and the island  Republic of CyprusAsia (from north to south): Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Israel.Africa (from east to west): Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco
Several other territories also border the Mediterranean Sea (from west to east):
The  Crown colony of GibraltarThe Spanish exclaves of  Ceuta and  Melilla and nearby islandsThe autonomous monastic state of  Mount AthosThe Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by TurkeyThe  sovereign base area of Akrotiri and DhekeliaThe Gaza Strip (governed by the  Palestinian National Authority)
Portugal, Armenia, Serbia and the Vatican City, although they do not border the sea, are often considered Mediterranean countries in a wider sense due to their Mediterranean climate, fauna and flora, and their cultural affinity with other Mediterranean countries. Subdivisions

The Mediterranean Sea is sub-divided into a number of smaller seas, each with their own designation (from west to east):
the  Alboran Sea, between Spain and Morocco,the  Balearic Sea, between mainland Spain and its  Balearic Islands,the  Ligurian Sea between  Corsica and  Liguria (Italy),the  Tyrrhenian Sea enclosed by  Sardinia,  Italian peninsula and  Sicily,the  Adriatic Sea between the Italian peninsula and the coasts of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Albaniathe  Ionian Sea between Italy, Greece, and Albania,the  Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey, with 
the  Thracian Sea in its north,the  Myrtoan Sea between the  Cyclades and the  Peloponnesos,the  Sea of Crete north of Crete, and
the  Libyan Sea south of  Crete, between the island and Libyathe  Sea of Marmara between the  Aegean and Black Seas.the  Cilician Sea between Turkey and Cyprus
Many of these smaller seas feature in local myth and folklore and derive their names from these associations. In addition to the seas, a number of  gulfs and  straits are also recognised:
the  Gulf of Corinth, an enclosed sea between the Ionian Sea and the  Corinth Canalthe  Saronic Gulf, the gulf of Athens, between the Corinth Canal and the  Mirtoan Seathe  Thermaic Gulf, the gulf of  Thessaloniki, located in the northern Greek region of  Macedoniathe  Gulf of Lion, south of Francethe  Strait of Messina, between  Sicily and the toe of Italythe  Gulf of Taranto, southern Italy,the  Strait of Otranto, between Italy and Albaniathe  Gulf of Haifa, between  Haifa and  Akko, Israelthe  Gulf of Sidra, between Tunisia and  Cyrenaica (eastern Libya)the  Strait of Sicily, between  Sicily and Tunisiathe  Corsica Channel, between  Corsica and Italythe  Strait of Bonifacio, between  Sardinia and  Corsicathe  Gulf of İskenderun, between  İskenderun and  Adana (Turkey)the  Gulf of Antalya, between west and east shores of Antalya (Turkey)
 Geology
The geology of the Mediterranean is complex, involving the break-up and then collision of the African and Eurasian plates, and the  Messinian Salinity Crisis in the late Miocene when the Mediterranean dried up.The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500  m and the deepest recorded point is 5267 meters (about 3.27 miles) in the  Calypso Deep in the  Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000  km. A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of  Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions (which in turn are divided into subdivisions), the Western Mediterranean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million  km² and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million  km².In the last few centuries, mankind has done much to alter Mediterranean geology. Structures have been built all along the coastlines, exacerbating and rerouting erosional patterns. Many pollution-producing boats travel the sea that unbalance the natural chemical ratios of the region. Beaches have been mismanaged, and the overuse of the sea's natural and marine resources continues to be a problem. This misuse speeds along and/or confounds natural processes. The actual geography has also been altered by the building of dams and canals.The Mediterranean was once thought to be the remnant of the  Tethys Ocean. It is now known to be a structurally younger ocean basin known as Neotethys. Neotethys formed during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic  rifting of the African and Eurasian plates. Ecology
As a result of the drying of the sea during the  Messinian Salinity Crisis, the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and Red seas. The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a  tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The  Bitter Lakes, which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. The construction of the  Aswan High Dam across the  Nile River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the eastern Mediterranean, which has made conditions there even more like the Red Sea. This species exchange is known as the  Lessepsian Migration, after  Ferdinand de Lesseps, the engineer who oversaw the canal's construction.

The geology of the Mediterranean is complex, involving the break-up and then collision of the African and Eurasian plates, and the  Messinian Salinity Crisis in the late Miocene when the Mediterranean dried up.The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500  m and the deepest recorded point is 5267 meters (about 3.27 miles) in the  Calypso Deep in the  Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000  km. A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of  Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions (which in turn are divided into subdivisions), the Western Mediterranean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million  km² and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million  km².In the last few centuries, mankind has done much to alter Mediterranean geology. Structures have been built all along the coastlines, exacerbating and rerouting erosional patterns. Many pollution-producing boats travel the sea that unbalance the natural chemical ratios of the region. Beaches have been mismanaged, and the overuse of the sea's natural and marine resources continues to be a problem. This misuse speeds along and/or confounds natural processes. The actual geography has also been altered by the building of dams and canals.The Mediterranean was once thought to be the remnant of the  Tethys Ocean. It is now known to be a structurally younger ocean basin known as Neotethys. Neotethys formed during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic  rifting of the African and Eurasian plates. Ecology
As a result of the drying of the sea during the  Messinian Salinity Crisis, the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and Red seas. The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a  tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The  Bitter Lakes, which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. The construction of the  Aswan High Dam across the  Nile River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the eastern Mediterranean, which has made conditions there even more like the Red Sea. This species exchange is known as the  Lessepsian Migration, after  Ferdinand de Lesseps, the engineer who oversaw the canal's construction.
