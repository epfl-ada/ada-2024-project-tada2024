Mendelevium ( IPA: /ˌmɛndəˈlɛviəm/), also known as unnilunium ( IPA: /ˌjuːniˈluːniəm/, symbol Unu) is a  synthetic element in the periodic table with the symbol Md (formerly Mv) and the  atomic number 101. A metallic  radioactive  transuranic element of the  actinides, mendelevium is synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with  alpha particles and was named after Dmitri Mendeleev.
 Notable characteristics
Researchers have shown that mendelevium has a moderately stable dipositive (II)  oxidation state in addition to the more characteristic (for actinide elements) tripositive (III) oxidation state. 256Md has been used to find out some of the chemical properties of this element while in an  aqueous solution. There are no other uses of mendelevium and only trace amounts of the element have ever been produced. History
Mendelevium (for  Dmitri Mendeleyev, surname commonly spelt as Mendeleev, Mendeléef, or even Mendelejeff, and first name sometimes spelt as Dmitry or Dmitriy) was first  synthesized by  Albert Ghiorso (team leader),  Glenn T. Seaborg,  Bernard Harvey, Greg Choppin, and  Stanley G. Thompson in early  1955. The team produced 256Md ( half-life of 76 minutes) when they bombarded an 253Es target with  alpha particles (helium nuclei) in the  Berkeley Radiation Laboratory's 60-inch  cyclotron (256Md was synthesized one-atom-at-a-time). Element 101 was the ninth  transuranic element synthesized. Isotopes
15  radioisotopes of mendelevium have been characterized, with the most stable being 258Md with a  half-life of 51.5 days, 260Md with a half-life of 31.8 days, and 257Md with a half-life of 5.52 hours. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 97 minutes, and the majority of these have half-lifes that are less than 5 minutes. This element also has 1  meta state, 258mMd (t½ 57 minutes). The isotopes of mendelevium range in  atomic weight from 245.091  amu (245Md) to 260.104 amu (260Md).
