Milk thistles are  thistles of the genus Silybum Adans.,  flowering plants of the daisy family ( Asteraceae). They are native to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

 Thistle Flower


Members of this genus grow as  annual or  biennial plants. The erect  stem is tall, branched and furrowed but not spiny. The large, alternate  leaves are waxy-lobed, toothed and thorny, as in other genera of thistle. The lower leaves are cauline (= attached to the stem without petiole). The upper leaves have a clasping base. They have large, disc-shaped pink-to-purple, rarely white, solitary flower  heads at the end of the stem. The flowers consist of tubular florets. The phyllaries under the flowers occur in many rows, with the outer row with spine-tipped lobes and apical  spines. The fruit is a black  achene with a white  pappus.Only two  species are currently classified in this genus:
Silybum eburneum Coss. & Dur., known as the Silver Milk Thistle, Elephant Thistle, or Ivory Thistle 
Silybum eburneum Coss. & Dur. var. hispanicum
Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertner, the  Blessed Milk Thistle, which has a large number of other common names, such as Variegated Thistle.
The two species  hybridise naturally, the hybrid being known as Silybum × gonzaloi Cantó , Sánchez Mata & Rivas Mart. (S. eburneum var. hispanicum x S. marianum)A number of other plants have been classified in this genus in the past but have since been relocated elsewhere in the light of additional research.S. marianum is by far the more widely known species. It is believed to give some remedy for  liver diseases(e.g.  viral hepatitis) and an extract,  silymarin, is used in medicine. The adverse effect of the medicinal use of milk thistle is loose stools.
