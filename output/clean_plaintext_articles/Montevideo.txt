 History
 Origin of Name
There are at least two explanations for the name Montevideo: The first states that it comes from the Portuguese "Monte vide eu" which means "I see a mountain". The second is that the Spaniards recorded the location of a mountain in a map as "Monte VI De Este a Oeste" meaning "The sixth mountain from east to west". The city's full original name is San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo. Early History
The Portuguese founded  Colonia del Sacramento in the 17th century despite Spanish claims to the area due to the  Treaty of Tordesillas. The Spanish chased the Portuguese out of a fort in the area in  1724. Then,  Bruno Mauricio de Zabala –  governor of Buenos Aires – founded the city on  December 24,  1726 to prevent further incursions.In  1828, the town became the capital of Uruguay.The city fell under heavy British influence from the early 19th century until the early 20th century as a way to circumvent  Argentine and Brazilian commercial control. It was repeatedly besieged by Argentinean dictator  Juan Manuel de Rosas between  1838 and  1851. Between  1860 and  1911, the British built an extensive  railroad network linking the city to the surrounding countryside. 20th Century
During World War II, a famous incident involving the German  pocket battleship  Admiral Graf Spee took place in Montevideo, which was a neutral port during the war. After the  Battle of the River Plate with the British navy on  December 13,  1939, the Graf Spee retreated to the port. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain  Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on  December 17. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. On  10 February  2006, the eagle figurehead of the Admiral Graf Spee was  recovered. To protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.Since  2005 the  Mayor of Montevideo (styled Intendente Municipal in Spanish) has been  Ricardo Ehrlich, of the  Frente Amplio (Broad Front), gaining 61% of the vote in the Mayoral elections, beating  Pedro Bordaberry of the  Partido Colorado, who scored 27%.Unlike its more well-known neighbour, Buenos Aires (Argentina), Montevideo is blessed with a natural harbour. Growth/economy
Montevideo began as a minor settlement. In  1860, Montevideo had a population of 37,787. By  1884, the population had grown to 104,472, including many immigrants. By this time, trade had become the main source of revenue for the city and it became a rival to Buenos Aires. During the early 20th century, many Europeans, mostly from Spain and Italy, immigrated to the city, and by  1908, 30% of the population was foreign born.During the mid-20th century, military dictatorship and  economic stagnation caused a decline whose residual effects are still seen today. Many rural poor flooded the city, with a large concentration in Ciudad Vieja.Recently, economic recovery and stronger trade ties with Uruguay's neighbours have led to renewed agricultural development and hopes for greater future prosperity.As of  2004, the city has a population of 1.35 million out of a total of 3.43 million in the country as a whole.  The greater  metropolitan area has 1.8 million people.Montevideo is served by  Carrasco International Airport.As of April 2006, Montevideo is ranked by Mercer Human Resource Consulting as the city in Latin America with the highest quality of life.

 World City Formation
The city shows some evidence of world city formation. The past lives on in style, though. Back in 1870, the average living standards there were higher than in the United States, and it shows. Take a walk through the Old City, where almost every street has a view of the water, sometimes at both ends, and you’ll discover a bounty of architectural treasures from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Then,  Bruno Mauricio de Zabala –  governor of Buenos Aires – founded the city on  December 24,  1726 to prevent further incursions.In  1828, the town became the capital of Uruguay.The city fell under heavy British influence from the early 19th century until the early 20th century as a way to circumvent  Argentine and Brazilian commercial control. It was repeatedly besieged by Argentinean dictator  Juan Manuel de Rosas between  1838 and  1851. Between  1860 and  1911, the British built an extensive  railroad network linking the city to the surrounding countryside. 20th Century
During World War II, a famous incident involving the German  pocket battleship  Admiral Graf Spee took place in Montevideo, which was a neutral port during the war. After the  Battle of the River Plate with the British navy on  December 13,  1939, the Graf Spee retreated to the port. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain  Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on  December 17. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. On  10 February  2006, the eagle figurehead of the Admiral Graf Spee was  recovered. To protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.Since  2005 the  Mayor of Montevideo (styled Intendente Municipal in Spanish) has been  Ricardo Ehrlich, of the  Frente Amplio (Broad Front), gaining 61% of the vote in the Mayoral elections, beating  Pedro Bordaberry of the  Partido Colorado, who scored 27%.Unlike its more well-known neighbour, Buenos Aires (Argentina), Montevideo is blessed with a natural harbour. Growth/economy
Montevideo began as a minor settlement. In  1860, Montevideo had a population of 37,787. By  1884, the population had grown to 104,472, including many immigrants. By this time, trade had become the main source of revenue for the city and it became a rival to Buenos Aires. During the early 20th century, many Europeans, mostly from Spain and Italy, immigrated to the city, and by  1908, 30% of the population was foreign born.During the mid-20th century, military dictatorship and  economic stagnation caused a decline whose residual effects are still seen today. Many rural poor flooded the city, with a large concentration in Ciudad Vieja.Recently, economic recovery and stronger trade ties with Uruguay's neighbours have led to renewed agricultural development and hopes for greater future prosperity.As of  2004, the city has a population of 1.35 million out of a total of 3.43 million in the country as a whole.  The greater  metropolitan area has 1.8 million people.Montevideo is served by  Carrasco International Airport.As of April 2006, Montevideo is ranked by Mercer Human Resource Consulting as the city in Latin America with the highest quality of life.

 Origin of Name
There are at least two explanations for the name Montevideo: The first states that it comes from the Portuguese "Monte vide eu" which means "I see a mountain". The second is that the Spaniards recorded the location of a mountain in a map as "Monte VI De Este a Oeste" meaning "The sixth mountain from east to west". The city's full original name is San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo. Early History

The city fell under heavy British influence from the early 19th century until the early 20th century as a way to circumvent  Argentine and Brazilian commercial control. It was repeatedly besieged by Argentinean dictator  Juan Manuel de Rosas between  1838 and  1851. Between  1860 and  1911, the British built an extensive  railroad network linking the city to the surrounding countryside. 20th Century
During World War II, a famous incident involving the German  pocket battleship  Admiral Graf Spee took place in Montevideo, which was a neutral port during the war. After the  Battle of the River Plate with the British navy on  December 13,  1939, the Graf Spee retreated to the port. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain  Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on  December 17. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. On  10 February  2006, the eagle figurehead of the Admiral Graf Spee was  recovered. To protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.Since  2005 the  Mayor of Montevideo (styled Intendente Municipal in Spanish) has been  Ricardo Ehrlich, of the  Frente Amplio (Broad Front), gaining 61% of the vote in the Mayoral elections, beating  Pedro Bordaberry of the  Partido Colorado, who scored 27%.Unlike its more well-known neighbour, Buenos Aires (Argentina), Montevideo is blessed with a natural harbour. Growth/economy
Montevideo began as a minor settlement. In  1860, Montevideo had a population of 37,787. By  1884, the population had grown to 104,472, including many immigrants. By this time, trade had become the main source of revenue for the city and it became a rival to Buenos Aires. During the early 20th century, many Europeans, mostly from Spain and Italy, immigrated to the city, and by  1908, 30% of the population was foreign born.During the mid-20th century, military dictatorship and  economic stagnation caused a decline whose residual effects are still seen today. Many rural poor flooded the city, with a large concentration in Ciudad Vieja.Recently, economic recovery and stronger trade ties with Uruguay's neighbours have led to renewed agricultural development and hopes for greater future prosperity.As of  2004, the city has a population of 1.35 million out of a total of 3.43 million in the country as a whole.  The greater  metropolitan area has 1.8 million people.Montevideo is served by  Carrasco International Airport.As of April 2006, Montevideo is ranked by Mercer Human Resource Consulting as the city in Latin America with the highest quality of life.

 World City Formation
The city shows some evidence of world city formation. The past lives on in style, though. Back in 1870, the average living standards there were higher than in the United States, and it shows. Take a walk through the Old City, where almost every street has a view of the water, sometimes at both ends, and you’ll discover a bounty of architectural treasures from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
