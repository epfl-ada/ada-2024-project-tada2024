The moorhens are medium-sized water birds which are members of the  rail  family  Rallidae. They constitute the genus Gallinula. They are relatives of  coots, and because of their apparently nervous behaviour (frequently twitching tail and neck) are sometimes called skitty coots.These rails are all brown and black with some white markings in plumage, and, unlike many of the rails, they are usually easy to see, feeding in open water margins rather than skulking in reedbeds.They tend to have short, rounded wings and be weak fliers, although usually capable of covering long distances; the  Common Moorhen in particular migrates up to 2,000 km from some of its breeding areas in the colder parts of  Siberia. Those that migrate do so at night. The  Gough Island Moorhen, on the other hand, is considered almost flightless - it can only flutter some meters.Moorhens can walk very well on strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces.These birds are  omnivorous, taking plant material, small animals and  eggs. They are aggressively territorial during the breeding season, but are otherwise often found in sizeable flocks on the shallow vegetated lakes they prefer.A fossil species, Gallinula kansarum, is known from Late Pliocene deposits in  Kansas. In addition, 2  chronosubspecies of extant species have been described: Gallinula chloropus brodkorbi from the  Pleistocene of  Ichetucknee River, and the doubtfully distinct Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene Gallinula mortierii reperta which refers to the population of the  Tasmanian Native-hen that once inhabited mainland Australia where the species became extinct at the end of the  last ice age (Olson 1975; Baird, 1984).Apart from the 3 extinctions in more recent times, 2 species have gone  extinct as a consequnce of early human settlement:  Hodgen's Waterhen (Gallinula hodgenorum) of New Zealand, and the undescribed  Viti Levu Gallinule of Fiji which would either be separated in Pareudiastes if that genus is considered valid, or may be a completely new genus. Similarly, the undescribed Mangaia "Swamphen" which is currently tentatively assigned to  Porphyrio may belong to Gallinula/Pareudiastes. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorhen"
