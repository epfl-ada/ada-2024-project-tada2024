The music of the Bahamas is associated primarily with  junkanoo, a celebration which occurs on  Boxing Day ( December 26) and again on  New Year's Day ( January 1).  Parades and other celebrations mark the ceremony. Groups like  The Baha Men,  Ronnie Butler and  Kirkland Bodie have gained massive popularity in Japan, the United States and elsewhere.
 Junkanoo


 Junkanoo celebration in  Nassau


The word junkanoo is said to be derived from a Ghanaian leader,  John Connu, or from the  Qujo supreme deity ( Canno) and ancestral spirits ( jannanin). The junkanoo was formerly practiced in  North Carolina and remnants still exist in Belize, Jamaica and, most commonly, Bermuda. Its capital, though, |Nassau]], and  Freeport and the  Family Islands. Bahamian music has been declining throughout the 20th century, partially due to the influence of  American culture and the proximity of TV and radio stations in Florida (which can be picked up in the Bahamas) as well as the arrival of musical forms like  calypso, reggae and  soca from Jamaica, Cuba and  Trinidad, among other Caribbean islands. Tourism has also had an impact, bringing in Japanese, European and North Americans with their attendant forms of cultural expression. In spite of this, Bahamian performers like  Joseph Spence have become underground stars playing junkanoo, Christian  hymns and the  ant'ems of the local  sponge fisherman, which include "Sloop John B", later made famous by  The Beach Boys.Junkanoo's origins are obscure and much-debated. Researchers like  E. Clement Bethel have studied the issue extensively, and likely conclusions include that African slaves were allowed celebrations only around  Christmas-time, and chose to celebrate John Connu, a headman from 18th century Africa. Another theory is that the term derives from scrap metal or other objects (junk) used to create the distinctive  goombay drum. Similar celebrations once existed cross the Caribbean and in North Carolina, but are now virtually extinct except in the Bahamas and Belize.

With the  1973 independence from the United Kingdom, black professionals of the middle- and upper-classes began to dominate junkanoo celebrations. Costuming and competitions became more complex and commonplace, and soon became a tourist draw.Aside from being a type of drum,  goombay is also a  percussion music made famous by  Alphonso 'Blind Blake' Higgs, who played to tourists arriving at  Nassau International Airport for several years.  Rake-and-scrape music is a unique type of instrumental music made by bending a saw and scraping with a small object, most typically a  screwdriver; it is used to accompany dances derived from European forms like  polka and  waltz. Rake-and-scrape's popularity has been declining in recent years, but performers like  Lassie Do and the Boys continue to keep the tradition alive. Christian  rhyming spirituals and the  ant'ems of  sponge fisherman are now mostly dead traditions, decimated by the arrival of pop music, a  1930s sponge blight and other causes. E. Clement Bethel's master's thesis on traditional Bahamian music was adapted for the stage by his daughter,  Nicolette Bethel and  Philip A. Burrows.  Music of The Bahamas was first performed at the  Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1991, and was revived in 2002 for fresh Bahamian audiences. A recording of that show is available for sale from  Ringplay Productions. Ripsaw



 Ripsaw music comes from the  musical traditions of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and is characterized by the use of a  saw as the primary instrument. It was brought by immigrants from those islands from the  1920s to about the  1940s, who settled on  Cat Island, and elsewhere. Many of these Turks and Caicos Islanders became some of the most famous musicians in the Bahamas. Many eventually moved back to their homelands, bringing with them junkanoo. Turks and Caicos are now the second home for junkanoo. Other
