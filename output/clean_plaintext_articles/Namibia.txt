Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia, is a country in southern Africa on the Atlantic coast. It shares borders with Angola, and Zambia to the north, Botswana to the east, and South Africa to the south. It gained independence from South Africa in  1990 and its capital city is  Windhoek. Namibia is a member state of the  Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the  Commonwealth of Nations.
 History



The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by  Bushmen,  Damara,  Namaqua, and since about the fourteenth century AD, by immigrating Bantu who came with the  Bantu expansion. The region was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century, when the land came under  German control as  South-West Africa -- apart from  Walvis Bay under British control. South Africa occupied the colony during World War I and administered it as a League of Nations  mandate territory until after World War II, when it unilaterally annexed the territory, albeit without international recognition.In  1966 the Marxist  South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO)  guerrilla group launched a war of independence, but it was not until  1988 that South Africa agreed to end its administration of Namibia, in accordance with a United Nations peace plan for the entire region. Independence came in  1990, and Walvis Bay was ceded to Namibia in  1994. Administrative divisions



Namibia is divided into  thirteen regions and subdivided into 102  constituencies.

 Geography


 A detailed map of Namibia, based on radar images from  The Map Library.





At 318,674  mi² (825,418  km² ), Namibia is the world's thirty-fourth largest country (after Venezuela). It is comparable in size to Pakistan, and is about half the size of the US state of  Alaska. After Mongolia, Namibia is the least densely populated country in the world (1.5 persons per km²).

 Dune in Namibia


The Namibian landscape consists primarily of central highlands, of which the highest point is the  Brandberg at 2,606 metres (8,550  ft). The central plateau runs from north to south, bordered by the  Namib Desert and its coastal plains to the west, the  Orange River to the south, and the  Kalahari Desert to the east.A remarkable strip of land in the northeast, known as the  Caprivi Strip is the vestige of a narrow corridor demarcated for the  German Empire to access the  Zambezi River.The Namibian climate ranges from  desert to subtropical, and is generally hot and dry;  precipitation is sparse and erratic. The cold, north-flowing  Benguela current accounts for some of the low precipitation. Besides the capital city  Windhoek in the centre of the country, other important towns are the ports of  Walvis Bay and  Swakopmund, as well as  Oshakati,  Grootfontein,  Tsumeb and  Keetmanshoop.

 Economy



The economy is very dependent on the extraction and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of the  GDP. Namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa, and the world's fifth largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten.About half of the population depends on agriculture (largely  subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in pronounced poverty because of large-scale  unemployment, the great inequality of income distribution, and the large amount of wealth going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has many close links to South Africa. Agreement has been reached on the  privatisation of several more enterprises in coming years, which should stimulate long-run foreign investment.

 Child labour occurs in Namibia, and the country is in the process of formulating an Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, which is expected to be adopted in the period 2006-2007. For more information, see  this article. Namibia is also one of the largest source of pollutants in the continent of Africa.It has been estimated that the total economic value (in real dollars) put into  MMOGs is equivalent to Namibia's GDP .

 Tourism


 Windhoek skyline





Namibia generally attracts  eco-tourists with the majority visiting to experience the different climates and natural geographical landscapes such as the great eastern desert and plains. There are many lodges and reserves for eco-tourists to travel to and stay over.

 Politics



The politics of Namibia takes place in a framework of a  presidential  representative democratic  republic, whereby the  President of Namibia is both  head of state and  head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of  parliament. The  Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Demographics

 Although its official language is English, Namibia is a multilingual country as it is illustrated on these examples in English, German, Afrikaans and Ovambo.





Namibia is among the three sovereign countries with the lowest population density. The majority of the Namibian population is black African – mostly of the  Ovambo tribe, which forms about half of the population – and concentrated in the north of the country. In addition to the  black Bantu majority, there are large groups of  Khoisan (e.g.  Nama and  Bushmen), who are descendants of the original inhabitants of Southern Africa. Khoisan differ significantly in appearance from both Bantu and  White Africans. Blacks of other Bantu descent are descendants of refugees from Angola. There are also two smaller groups of people with mixed racial origins, called " Coloureds" and " Basters", who together make up 8% (with the  Coloureds outnumbering the  Basters two to one). Whites of  Dutch,  German, British,  French and  Portuguese ancestry make up about 8% of the population – which is the second largest proportion in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa. Most of Namibian whites and nearly all those of mixed race are Afrikaans speakers and share similar origins, culture, religion and genealogy as the white and coloured populations of neighbouring South Africa. A smaller proportion of whites (around 30,000) trace their family origins directly back to German settlers and maintain German cultural and educational institutions. Nearly all Portuguese are white miners and settlers from their former colony of Angola.Half of all Namibians speak  Oshiwambo (Ovambo) as their first language, whereas the most widely understood language is Afrikaans. Among the younger generation, the most widely understood language is English. Both Afrikaans and English are used primarily as a second language reserved for public sphere communication, but small first language groups exist throughout the country. While the official language is English, most of the white population speaks either Afrikaans or German, both official languages until  1990 when Namibia became independent. Portuguese is spoken by blacks and whites from Angola. Christianity is the major religion, with the  Lutheran Church being the largest then followed by the Roman Catholic. Foreign relations



Namibia follows a largely independent  foreign policy, with lingering affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including Libya and Cuba.With a small army and a fragile economy, the Namibian Government's principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the Southern African region. A dynamic member of the  Southern African Development Community, Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration.Namibia became the 160th member of the United Nations on  April 23, 1990. On its independence it became the fiftieth member of the  Commonwealth of Nations.
The  Reporters Without Borders' Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2003 ranks Namibia as fifty-sixth out of 166 countries, as compared with thirty-first out of 139 countries in 2002.
 International disputes
Namibia is involved in several minor international disputes, including:
Small residual disputes with Botswana along the  Caprivi Strip, including the  Situngu marshlands~Kasikili Island as known in the Namibian side along the  Linyanti River, for which a commission to seek a resolution has been established;Protests from Botswanan residents against Namibia's planned construction of the  Okavango  hydroelectric dam at the  Popa Falls;A managed dispute with South Africa over the location of the boundary in the  Orange River;A dormant dispute over where the boundaries of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe converge;Angolan rebels and refugees that still reside in Namibia.
 Military



The constitution of Namibia defined the role of the military as "defending the territory and national interests." Namibia formed the  National Defence Force (NDF), comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war: the  Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and  South West African Territorial Force ( SWATF). The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element. The  United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG)'s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to assist in training the NDF and stabilize the north. According to the  Namibian Defence Ministry, enlistments of both men and women will number no more than 7,500. Defence and security account for less than 8% of government spending. Notables

The constitution of Namibia defined the role of the military as "defending the territory and national interests." Namibia formed the  National Defence Force (NDF), comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war: the  Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and  South West African Territorial Force ( SWATF). The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element. The  United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG)'s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to assist in training the NDF and stabilize the north. According to the  Namibian Defence Ministry, enlistments of both men and women will number no more than 7,500. Defence and security account for less than 8% of government spending. Notables

 Administrative divisions



Namibia is divided into  thirteen regions and subdivided into 102  constituencies.

 Geography


 A detailed map of Namibia, based on radar images from  The Map Library.





At 318,674  mi² (825,418  km² ), Namibia is the world's thirty-fourth largest country (after Venezuela). It is comparable in size to Pakistan, and is about half the size of the US state of  Alaska. After Mongolia, Namibia is the least densely populated country in the world (1.5 persons per km²).

 Dune in Namibia


The Namibian landscape consists primarily of central highlands, of which the highest point is the  Brandberg at 2,606 metres (8,550  ft). The central plateau runs from north to south, bordered by the  Namib Desert and its coastal plains to the west, the  Orange River to the south, and the  Kalahari Desert to the east.A remarkable strip of land in the northeast, known as the  Caprivi Strip is the vestige of a narrow corridor demarcated for the  German Empire to access the  Zambezi River.The Namibian climate ranges from  desert to subtropical, and is generally hot and dry;  precipitation is sparse and erratic. The cold, north-flowing  Benguela current accounts for some of the low precipitation. Besides the capital city  Windhoek in the centre of the country, other important towns are the ports of  Walvis Bay and  Swakopmund, as well as  Oshakati,  Grootfontein,  Tsumeb and  Keetmanshoop.

 Economy



The economy is very dependent on the extraction and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of the  GDP. Namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa, and the world's fifth largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten.About half of the population depends on agriculture (largely  subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in pronounced poverty because of large-scale  unemployment, the great inequality of income distribution, and the large amount of wealth going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has many close links to South Africa. Agreement has been reached on the  privatisation of several more enterprises in coming years, which should stimulate long-run foreign investment.

 Child labour occurs in Namibia, and the country is in the process of formulating an Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, which is expected to be adopted in the period 2006-2007. For more information, see  this article. Namibia is also one of the largest source of pollutants in the continent of Africa.It has been estimated that the total economic value (in real dollars) put into  MMOGs is equivalent to Namibia's GDP .

 Tourism


 Windhoek skyline





Namibia generally attracts  eco-tourists with the majority visiting to experience the different climates and natural geographical landscapes such as the great eastern desert and plains. There are many lodges and reserves for eco-tourists to travel to and stay over.

 Politics



The politics of Namibia takes place in a framework of a  presidential  representative democratic  republic, whereby the  President of Namibia is both  head of state and  head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of  parliament. The  Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Demographics


 A group of Herero women, Windhoek, Namibia




 A group of Himba women, near Opuwo, Namibia




 Although its official language is English, Namibia is a multilingual country as it is illustrated on these examples in English, German, Afrikaans and Ovambo.





Namibia is among the three sovereign countries with the lowest population density. The majority of the Namibian population is black African – mostly of the  Ovambo tribe, which forms about half of the population – and concentrated in the north of the country. In addition to the  black Bantu majority, there are large groups of  Khoisan (e.g.  Nama and  Bushmen), who are descendants of the original inhabitants of Southern Africa. Khoisan differ significantly in appearance from both Bantu and  White Africans. Blacks of other Bantu descent are descendants of refugees from Angola. There are also two smaller groups of people with mixed racial origins, called " Coloureds" and " Basters", who together make up 8% (with the  Coloureds outnumbering the  Basters two to one). Whites of  Dutch,  German, British,  French and  Portuguese ancestry make up about 8% of the population – which is the second largest proportion in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa. Most of Namibian whites and nearly all those of mixed race are Afrikaans speakers and share similar origins, culture, religion and genealogy as the white and coloured populations of neighbouring South Africa. A smaller proportion of whites (around 30,000) trace their family origins directly back to German settlers and maintain German cultural and educational institutions. Nearly all Portuguese are white miners and settlers from their former colony of Angola.Half of all Namibians speak  Oshiwambo (Ovambo) as their first language, whereas the most widely understood language is Afrikaans. Among the younger generation, the most widely understood language is English. Both Afrikaans and English are used primarily as a second language reserved for public sphere communication, but small first language groups exist throughout the country. While the official language is English, most of the white population speaks either Afrikaans or German, both official languages until  1990 when Namibia became independent. Portuguese is spoken by blacks and whites from Angola. Christianity is the major religion, with the  Lutheran Church being the largest then followed by the Roman Catholic. Foreign relations



Namibia follows a largely independent  foreign policy, with lingering affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including Libya and Cuba.With a small army and a fragile economy, the Namibian Government's principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the Southern African region. A dynamic member of the  Southern African Development Community, Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration.Namibia became the 160th member of the United Nations on  April 23, 1990. On its independence it became the fiftieth member of the  Commonwealth of Nations.
The  Reporters Without Borders' Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2003 ranks Namibia as fifty-sixth out of 166 countries, as compared with thirty-first out of 139 countries in 2002.
 International disputes
Namibia is involved in several minor international disputes, including:
Small residual disputes with Botswana along the  Caprivi Strip, including the  Situngu marshlands~Kasikili Island as known in the Namibian side along the  Linyanti River, for which a commission to seek a resolution has been established;Protests from Botswanan residents against Namibia's planned construction of the  Okavango  hydroelectric dam at the  Popa Falls;A managed dispute with South Africa over the location of the boundary in the  Orange River;A dormant dispute over where the boundaries of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe converge;Angolan rebels and refugees that still reside in Namibia.

Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in pronounced poverty because of large-scale  unemployment, the great inequality of income distribution, and the large amount of wealth going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has many close links to South Africa. Agreement has been reached on the  privatisation of several more enterprises in coming years, which should stimulate long-run foreign investment.

 Child labour occurs in Namibia, and the country is in the process of formulating an Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, which is expected to be adopted in the period 2006-2007.

Namibia is also one of the largest source of pollutants in the continent of Africa.It has been estimated that the total economic value (in real dollars) put into  MMOGs is equivalent to Namibia's GDP .

 Tourism


 Windhoek skyline





Namibia generally attracts  eco-tourists with the majority visiting to experience the different climates and natural geographical landscapes such as the great eastern desert and plains. There are many lodges and reserves for eco-tourists to travel to and stay over.

 Politics



The politics of Namibia takes place in a framework of a  presidential  representative democratic  republic, whereby the  President of Namibia is both  head of state and  head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of  parliament. The  Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Demographics

 A group of Himba women, near Opuwo, Namibia




 Although its official language is English, Namibia is a multilingual country as it is illustrated on these examples in English, German, Afrikaans and Ovambo.





Namibia is among the three sovereign countries with the lowest population density. The majority of the Namibian population is black African – mostly of the  Ovambo tribe, which forms about half of the population – and concentrated in the north of the country. In addition to the  black Bantu majority, there are large groups of  Khoisan (e.g.  Nama and  Bushmen), who are descendants of the original inhabitants of Southern Africa. Khoisan differ significantly in appearance from both Bantu and  White Africans. Blacks of other Bantu descent are descendants of refugees from Angola. There are also two smaller groups of people with mixed racial origins, called " Coloureds" and " Basters", who together make up 8% (with the  Coloureds outnumbering the  Basters two to one). Whites of  Dutch,  German, British,  French and  Portuguese ancestry make up about 8% of the population – which is the second largest proportion in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa. Most of Namibian whites and nearly all those of mixed race are Afrikaans speakers and share similar origins, culture, religion and genealogy as the white and coloured populations of neighbouring South Africa. A smaller proportion of whites (around 30,000) trace their family origins directly back to German settlers and maintain German cultural and educational institutions. Nearly all Portuguese are white miners and settlers from their former colony of Angola.Half of all Namibians speak  Oshiwambo (Ovambo) as their first language, whereas the most widely understood language is Afrikaans. Among the younger generation, the most widely understood language is English. Both Afrikaans and English are used primarily as a second language reserved for public sphere communication, but small first language groups exist throughout the country. While the official language is English, most of the white population speaks either Afrikaans or German, both official languages until  1990 when Namibia became independent. Portuguese is spoken by blacks and whites from Angola. Christianity is the major religion, with the  Lutheran Church being the largest then followed by the Roman Catholic. Foreign relations



Namibia follows a largely independent  foreign policy, with lingering affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including Libya and Cuba.With a small army and a fragile economy, the Namibian Government's principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the Southern African region. A dynamic member of the  Southern African Development Community, Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration.Namibia became the 160th member of the United Nations on  April 23, 1990. On its independence it became the fiftieth member of the  Commonwealth of Nations.
The  Reporters Without Borders' Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2003 ranks Namibia as fifty-sixth out of 166 countries, as compared with thirty-first out of 139 countries in 2002.
 International disputes
Namibia is involved in several minor international disputes, including:
Small residual disputes with Botswana along the  Caprivi Strip, including the  Situngu marshlands~Kasikili Island as known in the Namibian side along the  Linyanti River, for which a commission to seek a resolution has been established;Protests from Botswanan residents against Namibia's planned construction of the  Okavango  hydroelectric dam at the  Popa Falls;A managed dispute with South Africa over the location of the boundary in the  Orange River;A dormant dispute over where the boundaries of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe converge;Angolan rebels and refugees that still reside in Namibia.
 Military



The constitution of Namibia defined the role of the military as "defending the territory and national interests." Namibia formed the  National Defence Force (NDF), comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war: the  Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and  South West African Territorial Force ( SWATF). The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element. The  United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG)'s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to assist in training the NDF and stabilize the north. According to the  Namibian Defence Ministry, enlistments of both men and women will number no more than 7,500. Defence and security account for less than 8% of government spending. Notables

A remarkable strip of land in the northeast, known as the  Caprivi Strip is the vestige of a narrow corridor demarcated for the  German Empire to access the  Zambezi River.The Namibian climate ranges from  desert to subtropical, and is generally hot and dry;  precipitation is sparse and erratic. The cold, north-flowing  Benguela current accounts for some of the low precipitation. Besides the capital city  Windhoek in the centre of the country, other important towns are the ports of  Walvis Bay and  Swakopmund, as well as  Oshakati,  Grootfontein,  Tsumeb and  Keetmanshoop.

 Economy



The economy is very dependent on the extraction and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of the  GDP. Namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa, and the world's fifth largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten.About half of the population depends on agriculture (largely  subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood.

 Although its official language is English, Namibia is a multilingual country as it is illustrated on these examples in English, German, Afrikaans and Ovambo.





Namibia is among the three sovereign countries with the lowest population density. The majority of the Namibian population is black African – mostly of the  Ovambo tribe, which forms about half of the population – and concentrated in the north of the country. In addition to the  black Bantu majority, there are large groups of  Khoisan (e.g.  Nama and  Bushmen), who are descendants of the original inhabitants of Southern Africa. Khoisan differ significantly in appearance from both Bantu and  White Africans. Blacks of other Bantu descent are descendants of refugees from Angola. There are also two smaller groups of people with mixed racial origins, called " Coloureds" and " Basters", who together make up 8% (with the  Coloureds outnumbering the  Basters two to one). Whites of  Dutch,  German, British,  French and  Portuguese ancestry make up about 8% of the population – which is the second largest proportion in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa. Most of Namibian whites and nearly all those of mixed race are Afrikaans speakers and share similar origins, culture, religion and genealogy as the white and coloured populations of neighbouring South Africa. A smaller proportion of whites (around 30,000) trace their family origins directly back to German settlers and maintain German cultural and educational institutions. Nearly all Portuguese are white miners and settlers from their former colony of Angola.Half of all Namibians speak  Oshiwambo (Ovambo) as their first language, whereas the most widely understood language is Afrikaans. Among the younger generation, the most widely understood language is English. Both Afrikaans and English are used primarily as a second language reserved for public sphere communication, but small first language groups exist throughout the country. While the official language is English, most of the white population speaks either Afrikaans or German, both official languages until  1990 when Namibia became independent. Portuguese is spoken by blacks and whites from Angola. Christianity is the major religion, with the  Lutheran Church being the largest then followed by the Roman Catholic. Foreign relations



Namibia follows a largely independent  foreign policy, with lingering affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including Libya and Cuba.With a small army and a fragile economy, the Namibian Government's principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the Southern African region. A dynamic member of the  Southern African Development Community, Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration.Namibia became the 160th member of the United Nations on  April 23, 1990. On its independence it became the fiftieth member of the  Commonwealth of Nations.
The  Reporters Without Borders' Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2003 ranks Namibia as fifty-sixth out of 166 countries, as compared with thirty-first out of 139 countries in 2002.
 International disputes
Namibia is involved in several minor international disputes, including:
Small residual disputes with Botswana along the  Caprivi Strip, including the  Situngu marshlands~Kasikili Island as known in the Namibian side along the  Linyanti River, for which a commission to seek a resolution has been established;Protests from Botswanan residents against Namibia's planned construction of the  Okavango  hydroelectric dam at the  Popa Falls;A managed dispute with South Africa over the location of the boundary in the  Orange River;A dormant dispute over where the boundaries of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe converge;Angolan rebels and refugees that still reside in Namibia.
 Military



The constitution of Namibia defined the role of the military as "defending the territory and national interests." Namibia formed the  National Defence Force (NDF), comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war: the  Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and  South West African Territorial Force ( SWATF). The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element. The  United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG)'s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to assist in training the NDF and stabilize the north. According to the  Namibian Defence Ministry, enlistments of both men and women will number no more than 7,500. Defence and security account for less than 8% of government spending. Notables

 Tourism


 Windhoek skyline





Namibia generally attracts  eco-tourists with the majority visiting to experience the different climates and natural geographical landscapes such as the great eastern desert and plains. There are many lodges and reserves for eco-tourists to travel to and stay over.

 Politics



The politics of Namibia takes place in a framework of a  presidential  representative democratic  republic, whereby the  President of Namibia is both  head of state and  head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of  parliament. The  Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Demographics

 Demographics

 A group of Himba women, near Opuwo, Namibia




 Although its official language is English, Namibia is a multilingual country as it is illustrated on these examples in English, German, Afrikaans and Ovambo.





Namibia is among the three sovereign countries with the lowest population density. The majority of the Namibian population is black African – mostly of the  Ovambo tribe, which forms about half of the population – and concentrated in the north of the country. In addition to the  black Bantu majority, there are large groups of  Khoisan (e.g.  Nama and  Bushmen), who are descendants of the original inhabitants of Southern Africa. Khoisan differ significantly in appearance from both Bantu and  White Africans. Blacks of other Bantu descent are descendants of refugees from Angola. There are also two smaller groups of people with mixed racial origins, called " Coloureds" and " Basters", who together make up 8% (with the  Coloureds outnumbering the  Basters two to one). Whites of  Dutch,  German, British,  French and  Portuguese ancestry make up about 8% of the population – which is the second largest proportion in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa. Most of Namibian whites and nearly all those of mixed race are Afrikaans speakers and share similar origins, culture, religion and genealogy as the white and coloured populations of neighbouring South Africa. A smaller proportion of whites (around 30,000) trace their family origins directly back to German settlers and maintain German cultural and educational institutions. Nearly all Portuguese are white miners and settlers from their former colony of Angola.Half of all Namibians speak  Oshiwambo (Ovambo) as their first language, whereas the most widely understood language is Afrikaans. Among the younger generation, the most widely understood language is English. Both Afrikaans and English are used primarily as a second language reserved for public sphere communication, but small first language groups exist throughout the country. While the official language is English, most of the white population speaks either Afrikaans or German, both official languages until  1990 when Namibia became independent. Portuguese is spoken by blacks and whites from Angola. Christianity is the major religion, with the  Lutheran Church being the largest then followed by the Roman Catholic. Foreign relations



Namibia follows a largely independent  foreign policy, with lingering affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including Libya and Cuba.With a small army and a fragile economy, the Namibian Government's principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the Southern African region. A dynamic member of the  Southern African Development Community, Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration.Namibia became the 160th member of the United Nations on  April 23, 1990. On its independence it became the fiftieth member of the  Commonwealth of Nations.
The  Reporters Without Borders' Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2003 ranks Namibia as fifty-sixth out of 166 countries, as compared with thirty-first out of 139 countries in 2002.
 International disputes
Namibia is involved in several minor international disputes, including:
Small residual disputes with Botswana along the  Caprivi Strip, including the  Situngu marshlands~Kasikili Island as known in the Namibian side along the  Linyanti River, for which a commission to seek a resolution has been established;Protests from Botswanan residents against Namibia's planned construction of the  Okavango  hydroelectric dam at the  Popa Falls;A managed dispute with South Africa over the location of the boundary in the  Orange River;A dormant dispute over where the boundaries of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe converge;Angolan rebels and refugees that still reside in Namibia.
 Military



The constitution of Namibia defined the role of the military as "defending the territory and national interests." Namibia formed the  National Defence Force (NDF), comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war: the  Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and  South West African Territorial Force ( SWATF). The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element. The  United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG)'s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to assist in training the NDF and stabilize the north.
