Neodymium ( IPA: /ˌniːə(ʊ)ˈdɪmiəm, ˌniə(ʊ)-/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Nd and  atomic number 60.
 Notable characteristics
Neodymium, a  rare earth metal, is present in  misch metal to the extent of about 18%. The metal has a bright silvery metallic luster; however, being one of the more reactive rare earth metals, neodymium quickly tarnishes in air, forming an oxide that falls off and exposes the metal to further oxidation. Although belonging to rare earth metals, neodymium is not rare at all. It constitutes 38 ppm of Earth’s crust. Applications
Uses of neodymium include
Neodymium is a component of  didymium used for colouring glass to make welder's goggles.Neodymium colours glass in delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine-red and warm grey. Light transmitted through such glass shows unusually sharp  absorption bands; the glass is used in astronomical work to produce sharp bands by which  spectral lines may be calibrated. Neodymium is also used to remove the green colour caused by iron contaminants from glass.Neodymium salts are used as a colourant for  enamels.Neodymium is used in the strongest permanent magnets known -  Nd2Fe14B. These magnets are cheaper, lighter, and stronger than  samarium-cobalt magnets.  Neodymium magnets appear in high-quality products such as  microphones, professional  loudspeakers, in-ear  headphones and computer  hard disks where low mass, small volume, or strong magnetic fields are required.Probably because of similarities to Ca2+, Nd3+ has been reported   to promote plant growth. Rare earth element compounds are frequently used in China as fertilizer.Size and strength of volcanic eruption can be predicted by scanning for neodymium isotopes. Small and large volcanic eruptions produce lava with different neodymium isotope composition. From the composition of isotopes, scientists predict how big the coming eruption will be, and use this information to warn residents of the intensity of the eruption.Certain transparent materials with a small concentration of neodymium  ions can be used in  lasers as  gain media for infrared wavelengths (1054-1064 nm), e.g.  Nd:YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet), Nd:YLF (yttrium lithium fluoride),  Nd:YVO4 (yttrium orthvanadate), and Nd:glass. The current laser at the UK  Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), the HELEN 1-TW neodymium-glass laser, can access the midpoints of pressure and temperature regions and is used to acquire data for modelling on how density, temperature and pressure interact inside warheads. HELEN can create plasmas of around 106  K, from which opacity and transmission of radiation are measured.Neodymium glass (Nd:Glass)  solid-state lasers are used in extremely high power ( terawatt scale), high energy ( megajoules) multiple beam systems for  inertial confinement fusion. Nd:Glass lasers are usually  frequency tripled to the  third harmonic at 351 nm in laser fusion devices.

 History
Neodymium was discovered by Baron  Carl Auer von Welsbach, an Austrian  chemist, in Vienna in  1885. He separated neodymium, as well as the element praseodymium, from a material known as  didymium by means of  spectroscopic analysis; however, it was not isolated in relatively pure form until  1925. The name neodymium is derived from the  Greek words neos, new, and didymos, twin. Neodymium is frequently  misspelled as neodynium.Today, neodymium is primarily obtained through an  ion exchange process of  monazite sand ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO4), a material rich in rare earth elements, and through  electrolysis of its  halide salts. Occurrence
Neodymium is never found in nature as the free element; rather, it occurs in ores such as  monazite sand ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO4) and  bastnasite ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)(CO3)F) that contain small amounts of all the rare earth metals. Neodymium can also be found in  Misch metal; it is difficult to separate it from other rare earth elements. Compounds

 NdF3 NdCl3 NdBr3 NdI3
Oxides

 Isotopes
Naturally occurring Neodymium is composed of 5 stable  isotopes, 142Nd, 143Nd, 145Nd, 146Nd and 148Nd, with 142Nd being the most abundant (27.2%  natural abundance), and 2  radioisotopes, 144Nd and 150Nd. In all, 31 radioisotopes of Neodymium have been characterized, with the most stable being 150Nd with a  half-life (T½) of >1.1×1019 years, 144Nd with a half-life of 2.29×1015 years, and 147Nd with a half-life of 10.98 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 3.38 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 71 seconds. This element also has 4  meta states with the most stable being 139Ndm (T½ 5.5 hours), 135Ndm (T½ 5.5 minutes) and 141Ndm (T½ 62.0 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 142Nd, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 142Nd are element Pr (praseodymium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Pm (promethium) isotopes. Precautions
Neodymium metal dust is a combustion and explosion hazard.Neodymium compounds, like all rare earth metals, are of low to moderate toxicity; however its toxicity has not been thoroughly investigated. Neodymium dust and salts are very irritating to the eyes and  mucous membranes, and moderately irritating to skin. Breathing the dust can cause lung  embolisms, and accumulated exposure damages the liver. Neodymium also acts as an  anticoagulant, especially when given intravenously.Neodymium magnets have been tested for medical uses such as magnetic braces and bone repair, but  biocompatibility issues have prevented widespread application.

Neodymium was discovered by Baron  Carl Auer von Welsbach, an Austrian  chemist, in Vienna in  1885. He separated neodymium, as well as the element praseodymium, from a material known as  didymium by means of  spectroscopic analysis; however, it was not isolated in relatively pure form until  1925. The name neodymium is derived from the  Greek words neos, new, and didymos, twin. Neodymium is frequently  misspelled as neodynium.Today, neodymium is primarily obtained through an  ion exchange process of  monazite sand ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO4), a material rich in rare earth elements, and through  electrolysis of its  halide salts. Occurrence
Neodymium is never found in nature as the free element; rather, it occurs in ores such as  monazite sand ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO4) and  bastnasite ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)(CO3)F) that contain small amounts of all the rare earth metals. Neodymium can also be found in  Misch metal; it is difficult to separate it from other rare earth elements. Compounds
Neodymium compounds include
Halides 
 NdF3 NdCl3 NdBr3 NdI3
Oxides 
 Nd2O3
Sulfides 
 NdS Nd2S3
Nitrides 
 NdN

 Isotopes
Naturally occurring Neodymium is composed of 5 stable  isotopes, 142Nd, 143Nd, 145Nd, 146Nd and 148Nd, with 142Nd being the most abundant (27.2%  natural abundance), and 2  radioisotopes, 144Nd and 150Nd. In all, 31 radioisotopes of Neodymium have been characterized, with the most stable being 150Nd with a  half-life (T½) of >1.1×1019 years, 144Nd with a half-life of 2.29×1015 years, and 147Nd with a half-life of 10.98 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 3.38 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 71 seconds. This element also has 4  meta states with the most stable being 139Ndm (T½ 5.5 hours), 135Ndm (T½ 5.5 minutes) and 141Ndm (T½ 62.0 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 142Nd, is  electron capture and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 142Nd are element Pr (praseodymium) isotopes and the primary products after are element Pm (promethium) isotopes. Precautions
Neodymium metal dust is a combustion and explosion hazard.Neodymium compounds, like all rare earth metals, are of low to moderate toxicity; however its toxicity has not been thoroughly investigated. Neodymium dust and salts are very irritating to the eyes and  mucous membranes, and moderately irritating to skin. Breathing the dust can cause lung  embolisms, and accumulated exposure damages the liver. Neodymium also acts as an  anticoagulant, especially when given intravenously.Neodymium magnets have been tested for medical uses such as magnetic braces and bone repair, but  biocompatibility issues have prevented widespread application.
