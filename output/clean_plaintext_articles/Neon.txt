Neon ( IPA: /ˈniːɒn/) is the chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Ne and  atomic number 10. A colorless, nearly  inert  noble gas, neon gives a distinct reddish glow when used in vacuum discharge tubes and  neon lamps and is found in air in trace amounts.
 Notable characteristics
Neon is the second-lightest  noble gas, glows  reddish- orange in a  vacuum discharge tube and has over 40 times the  refrigerating capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis). In most applications it is a less expensive  refrigerant than helium. Neon has the most intense discharge at normal voltages and currents of all the rare gases. Applications


 Neon is often used in  signs and produces an unmistakable bright orange colored light. All other colors (though still referred to as "neon") are created using a mercury vapor discharge which excites a  phosphor via  fluorescence.


The reddish-orange colour that neon emits in  neon lights is widely used to make advertising  signs and is also used in long tubular strips in car modification. The word "neon" is also used generically for these types of lights even though many other gases are used to produce different colors of light. Other uses:
vacuum tubeshigh-voltage indicatorslightning arrestorswave meter tubestelevision tubesNeon and helium are used to make a type of gas  laserLiquefied neon is commercially used as a  cryogenic  refrigerant in applications not requiring the lower temperature range attainable with more expensive liquid helium refrigeration.
 History
Neon ( Greek νέος meaning "new") was discovered by Scottish chemist  William Ramsay and English chemist  Morris Travers in  1898. Occurrence
Neon is a  monatomic gas at  standard conditions. Neon is rare, found in the Earth's atmosphere at 1 part in 65,000 and industrially produced by cryogenic  fractional distillation of liquified air. Compounds
The  ions, Ne+, (NeAr)+, (NeH)+, and (HeNe+), have been observed from optical and  mass spectrometric research. In addition, neon forms an unstable  hydrate. Isotopes
Neon has three  stable isotopes: 20Ne (90.48%), 21Ne (0.27%) and 22Ne (9.25%). 21Ne and 22Ne are  nucleogenic and their variations are well understood. In contrast, 20Ne is not known to be nucleogenic and the causes of its variation in the Earth have been hotly debated. The principal  nuclear reactions which generate neon  isotopes are  neutron emission,  alpha decay reactions on 24Mg and 25Mg, which produce 21Ne and 22Ne, respectively. The  alpha particles are derived from uranium-series  decay chains, while the neutrons are mostly produced by secondary reactions from alpha particles. The net result yields a trend towards lower 20Ne/22Ne and higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites. Isotopic analysis of exposed terrestrial  rocks has demonstrated the  cosmogenic production of 21Ne. This isotope is generated by  spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic  exposure ages of surficial rocks and  meteorites. Similar to xenon, neon content observed in samples of volcanic gases are enriched in 20Ne, as well as nucleogenic 21Ne, relative to 22Ne content. The neon isotopic content of these mantle-derived samples represent a non-atmospheric source of neon. The 20Ne-enriched components are attributed to exotic primordial rare gas components in the Earth, possibly representing  solar neon. Elevated 20Ne abundances are also found in diamonds, further suggesting a solar neon reservoir in the Earth.  Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon"
