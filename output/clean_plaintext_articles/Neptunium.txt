Neptunium ( IPA: /ˌnɛpˈt(j)uːniəm/) is an element in the periodic table that has the symbol Np and  atomic number 93. A silvery  radioactive metallic element, neptunium is the first  transuranic element and belongs to the  actinide series. Its most stable  isotope, 237Np, is a by-product of  nuclear reactors and plutonium production and it can be used as a component in neutron detection equipment. Neptunium is also found in trace amounts in uranium ores.
 Notable characteristics
Silvery in appearance, neptunium metal is fairly chemically  reactive and is found in at least three structural modifications:
alpha-neptunium, orthorhombic, density 20.25 Mg/m3,beta-neptunium (above 280 °C), tetragonal, density (313 °C) 19.36 Mg/m3, andgamma-neptunium (above 577 °C), cubic, density (600 °C) 18 Mg/m3
This element has four ionic  oxidation states while in solution:
Np+3 (pale purple), analogous to the rare earth ion Pm+3,Np+4 (yellow green);NpO2+ (green blue): andNpO2++ (pale pink).
Neptunium forms tri- and tetra halides such as NpF3, NpF4, NpCl4, NpBr3, NpI3, and  oxides of the various compositions such as are found in the uranium-oxygen system, including Np3O8 and NpO2.Neptunium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide neptunyl core (NpO2). In the environment, this neptunyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties (OH-, NO2-, NO3-, and SO4-2) to form charged complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.

 Precursor in Plutonium-238 Production
237Np is irradiated with neutrons to create  238Pu, a rare and valuable isotope for spacecraft and military applications. Weapons applications
Neptunium is fissionable, and could theoretically be used as reactor fuel or to create a nuclear weapon. It is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using Neptunium.In September 2002, researchers at the  University of California  Los Alamos National Laboratory created the first known nuclear critical mass using neptunium in combination with  enriched uranium, discovering that the  critical mass of neptunium is less than previously predicted. US officials in March 2004, planned to move the nation's supply of enriched neptunium to a site in Nevada. History
Neptunium (named for the planet  Neptune) was first  discovered by  Edwin McMillan and  Philip Abelson in  1940. Initially predicted by  Walter Russell's "spiral" organization of the periodic table, it was found at the  Berkeley Radiation Laboratory of the  University of California, Berkeley where the team produced the neptunium  isotope 239Np (2.4 day  half-life) by bombarding uranium with slow moving neutrons. It was the first  transuranium element produced synthetically and the first  actinide series transuranium element discovered. Occurrence
Trace amounts of neptunium are found naturally as  decay products from  transmutation reactions in  uranium ores. 237Np is produced through the  reduction of 237NpF3 with barium or lithium vapor at around 1200 °  C and is most often extracted from spent  nuclear fuel rods as a by-product in plutonium production. Nuclear synthesis
When an 235U atom captures a neutron, it is converted to an excited state of 236U. About 81% of the excited 236U nuclei undergo fission, but the remainder decay to the ground state of 236U by emitting gamma radiation. Further neutron capture creates 237U which has a half-life of 7 days and thus quickly decays to 237Np. Since nearly all neptunium is produced in this way or consists of isotopes which decay quickly, one gets nearly pure 237Np by chemical separation of neptunium. Isotopes
19 neptunium  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being 237Np with a  half-life of 2.14 million years, 236Np with a half-life of 154,000 years, and 235Np with a half-life of 396.1 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 4.5 days, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 50 minutes. This element also has 4  meta states, with the most stable being 236mNp (t½ 22.5 hours).The isotopes of neptunium range in  atomic weight from 225.0339  u (225Np) to 244.068 u (244Np). The primary  decay mode before the most stable isotope, 237Np, is  electron capture (with a good deal of  alpha emission), and the primary mode after is  beta emission. The primary  decay products before 237Np are element 92 (uranium) isotopes (alpha emission produces element 91, protactinium, however) and the primary products after are element 94 (plutonium) isotopes.237Np eventually decays to form bismuth, unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay to make lead.

It is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using Neptunium.In September 2002, researchers at the  University of California  Los Alamos National Laboratory created the first known nuclear critical mass using neptunium in combination with  enriched uranium, discovering that the  critical mass of neptunium is less than previously predicted. US officials in March 2004, planned to move the nation's supply of enriched neptunium to a site in Nevada. History
Neptunium (named for the planet  Neptune) was first  discovered by  Edwin McMillan and  Philip Abelson in  1940. Initially predicted by  Walter Russell's "spiral" organization of the periodic table, it was found at the  Berkeley Radiation Laboratory of the  University of California, Berkeley where the team produced the neptunium  isotope 239Np (2.4 day  half-life) by bombarding uranium with slow moving neutrons. It was the first  transuranium element produced synthetically and the first  actinide series transuranium element discovered. Occurrence
Trace amounts of neptunium are found naturally as  decay products from  transmutation reactions in  uranium ores. 237Np is produced through the  reduction of 237NpF3 with barium or lithium vapor at around 1200 °  C and is most often extracted from spent  nuclear fuel rods as a by-product in plutonium production. Nuclear synthesis
When an 235U atom captures a neutron, it is converted to an excited state of 236U. About 81% of the excited 236U nuclei undergo fission, but the remainder decay to the ground state of 236U by emitting gamma radiation. Further neutron capture creates 237U which has a half-life of 7 days and thus quickly decays to 237Np. Since nearly all neptunium is produced in this way or consists of isotopes which decay quickly, one gets nearly pure 237Np by chemical separation of neptunium. Isotopes
19 neptunium  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being 237Np with a  half-life of 2.14 million years, 236Np with a half-life of 154,000 years, and 235Np with a half-life of 396.1 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 4.5 days, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 50 minutes. This element also has 4  meta states, with the most stable being 236mNp (t½ 22.5 hours).The isotopes of neptunium range in  atomic weight from 225.0339  u (225Np) to 244.068 u (244Np). The primary  decay mode before the most stable isotope, 237Np, is  electron capture (with a good deal of  alpha emission), and the primary mode after is  beta emission. The primary  decay products before 237Np are element 92 (uranium) isotopes (alpha emission produces element 91, protactinium, however) and the primary products after are element 94 (plutonium) isotopes.237Np eventually decays to form bismuth, unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay to make lead.

Further neutron capture creates 237U which has a half-life of 7 days and thus quickly decays to 237Np. Since nearly all neptunium is produced in this way or consists of isotopes which decay quickly, one gets nearly pure 237Np by chemical separation of neptunium. Isotopes
19 neptunium  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being 237Np with a  half-life of 2.14 million years, 236Np with a half-life of 154,000 years, and 235Np with a half-life of 396.1 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 4.5 days, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 50 minutes. This element also has 4  meta states, with the most stable being 236mNp (t½ 22.5 hours).The isotopes of neptunium range in  atomic weight from 225.0339  u (225Np) to 244.068 u (244Np). The primary  decay mode before the most stable isotope, 237Np, is  electron capture (with a good deal of  alpha emission), and the primary mode after is  beta emission. The primary  decay products before 237Np are element 92 (uranium) isotopes (alpha emission produces element 91, protactinium, however) and the primary products after are element 94 (plutonium) isotopes.237Np eventually decays to form bismuth, unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay to make lead.
