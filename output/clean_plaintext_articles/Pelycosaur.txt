The pelycosaurs (from  Greek pelyx meaning 'bowl' and sauros meaning 'lizard') were smallish to large (up to 3 meters or more) primitive Late  Paleozoic  synapsid  amniotes. They appeared during the  Late Carboniferous and reached their acme in the  early part of the Permian  Period, remaining the dominant land animals for many millions of years. A few stragglers continued into the  late Permian.At least two pelycosaur  clades independently evolved a tall sail, consisting of elongated vertebral spines: the  edaphosaurids and the  sphenacodontids. In life, this would have been covered by skin, and possibly functioned as a  thermoregulatory device or for mating display. Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America, although some small, late-surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa.Well-known pelycosaurs include the  genera Dimetrodon,  Sphenacodon,  Edaphosaurus, and  Ophiacodon.In  1940 the group was reviewed in detail and every species known at the time described (and many illustrated) in an important monograph by  Alfred Sherwood Romer and  Llewellyn Price.Pelycosauria is a  paraphyletic taxon because it excludes the  therapsids. For that reason the term is not used in some modern books.  Eupelycosauria is used to designate the clade that includes most Pelycosaurs along with the Therapsida and the Mammals. In contrast to "Pelycosaurs", this is  monophyletic group.  Caseasauria refers to a pelycosaur side-branch or clade that did not leave any descendents.The pelycosaurs appear to have been a group of reptiles that had direct ancestral links with the mammalia, having differentiated teeth and a developing hard palate.
