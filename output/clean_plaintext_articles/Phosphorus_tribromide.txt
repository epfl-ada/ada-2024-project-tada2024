Phosphorus tribromide is a colourless liquid with the formula P Br 3 . It fumes in air due to hydrolysis and has a penetrating odour. It is widely used in the laboratory for the conversion of alcohols to alkyl bromides.
## Chemical properties
Phosphorus tribromide, like PCl 3 and PF 3 , has both properties of a Lewis base and a Lewis acid. For example, with a Lewis acid such as boron tribromide it forms stable 1:1 adducts such as Br 3 B-PBr 3 . At the same time PBr 3 can react as an electrophile or Lewis acid in many of its reactions, for example with amines.
The most important reaction of PBr 3 is with alcohols, where it replaces an OH group with a bromine atom to produce an alkyl bromide. Note that all three bromines can be transferred.
PBr 3 + 3 ROH → 3 RBr + HP(O)(OH) 2
The mechanism (shown for a primary alcohol) involves initial activation of the alcohol oxygen by the electrophilic phosphorus (to form a good leaving group), followed by an S N 2 substitution at the alcohol carbon.
Because of the S N 2 substitution step, the reaction generally works well for primary and secondary alcohols, but fails for tertiary alcohols. If the reacting carbon centre is chiral, the reaction usually occurs with inversion of configuration at the alcohol carbon, as is usual with an S N 2 reaction.
In a similar reaction, PBr 3 also converts carboxylic acids to acyl bromides.
PBr 3 + 3 RCOOH → 3 RCOBr + HP(O)(OH) 2
PBr 3 is a reasonably strong reducing agent, and the oxidation of PBr 3 with oxygen gas is more vigorous than seen with PCl 3 . It gives an explosive reaction that forms P 2 O 5 and Br 2 .
## Preparation
PBr 3 is by treating phosphorus with bromine , using PBr 3 itself as the solvent (white phosphorus is soluble in PBr 3 ). An excess of phosphorus is used in order to prevent formation of PBr 5 .
P 4 + 6 Br 2 → 4 PBr 3
## Uses
The main use for phosphorus tribromide is for conversion of primary or secondary alcohols to alkyl bromides , as described above . PBr 3 usually gives higher yields than hydrobromic acid, and it avoids problems of carbocation rearrangement- for example even neopentyl bromide can be made from the alcohol in 60% yield .
Another use for PBr 3 is as a catalyst for the α-bromination of carboxylic acids. Although acyl bromides are rarely made in comparison with acyl chlorides, they are used as intermediates in Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation . Initially PBr 3 reacts with the carboxylic acid to form the acyl bromide, which is more reactive towards bromination. The overall process can be represented as
On a commercial scale, phosphorus tribromide is used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals such as alprazolam, methohexital and fenoprofen. It is also a potent fire suppression agent marketed under the name PhostrEx.
## Precautions
PBr 3 evolves corrosive HBr, is toxic, and reacts violently with water and alcohols.
In reactions that produce phosphorous acid as a by-product, when working up by distillation be aware that this can decompose above about 160 °C to give phosphine which can cause explosions in contact with air.
