Phosphorus trichloride (formula PCl3) is the most important of the three  phosphorus chlorides. It is an important  industrial chemical, being used for the manufacture of organophosphorus compounds for a wide variety of applications.
 Chemical properties
The phosphorus in PCl3 is often considered to have the +3  oxidation state and the chlorine atoms are considered to be in the -1 oxidation state. Most of its reactivity is consistent with this description. Redox reactions
PCl3 is a precursor to other phosphorus compound, undergoing  oxidation to  phosphorus pentachloride,  PSCl3, and  phosphorus oxychloride.If an  electric discharge is passed through a mixture of PCl3 vapour and hydrogen gas, a rare chloride of phosphorus is formed, diphosphorus tetrachloride (P2Cl4). PCl3 as an electrophile
Phosphorus trichloride is the precursor to  organophosphorus compounds that contain one or more (P3+) atoms, most notably phosphites and phosphonates. These compounds do not usually contain the chlorine atoms found in PCl3.PCl3 reacts rapidly and  exothermically with  water to form  phosphorous acid, H3PO3 and HCl. A large number of similar substitution reactions are known, the most important of which is the formation of  phosphite esters by reaction with alcohols or  phenols. For example, with  phenol, triphenyl phosphite is formed:
3  PhOH + PCl3 →  P(OPh)3 + 3 HCl
where "Ph" stands for  phenyl group, -C6H5. Alcohols such as ethanol react similarly in the presence of a  base such as  triethylamine to give phosphite esters such as  triethyl phosphite ( ethyl is -C2H5):
3 C2H5OH + PCl3 → P(OC2H5)3 + 3 HCl
In the absence of base, however, the reaction affords a dialkyl  phosphonate and an  alkyl chloride, according to the following stoichiometry:
PCl3 + 3 C2H5OH → (C2H5O)2P(=O)H +  C2H5Cl + 2 HCl
 Amines, R2NH, form P(NR2)3, and  thiols (RSH) form P(SR)3. An industrially relevant reaction of PCl3 with amines is phosphonomethylation, which employs  formaldehyde:
R2NH + PCl3 + CH2O →  (HO)2P(O)CH2NR2 + 3 HCl
 Aminophosphonates are widely used as sequestring and antiscale agents in water treatment. The large volume herbicide  glyphosate is also produced this way. The reaction of PCl3 with  Grignard reagents and  organolithium reagents is a useful method for the preparation of organic  phosphines with the formula R3P (sometimes called phosphanes) such as triphenylphosphine, Ph3P.
3 PhMgBr + PCl3 →  Ph3P + 3 MgBrCl
Under controlled conditions PCl3 can be used to prepare PhPCl2 and Ph2PCl. PCl3 as a nucleophile
Phosphorus trichloride has a lone pair, and therefore can act as a  Lewis base, for example with the  Lewis acids BBr3 it forms a 1:1 adduct, Br3B−−+PCl3. Metal complexes such as Ni(PCl3)4 are known. This Lewis basicity is exploited in one useful route to organophosphorus compounds:
PCl3 +  RCl + AlCl3 → (RPCl3)+ −AlCl4
The (RPCl3)+ product can then be decomposed with water to produce an alkylphosphonic dichloride RP(=O)Cl2. Preparation
World production exceeds one-third of a million  tonnes. Phosphorus trichloride is prepared industrially by the reaction of chlorine with a  refluxing solution of white phosphorus in phosphorus trichloride, with continuous removal of PCl3 as it is formed.
P4 + 6 Cl2 → 4 PCl3
Industrial production of phosphorus trichloride is controlled under the  Chemical Weapons Convention, where it is listed in  schedule 3.In the laboratory it may be more convenient to use the less toxic red phosphorus. It is sufficiently inexpensive that it would not be synthesized for laboratory use. Uses
PCl3 is important indirectly as a precursor to  PCl5,  POCl3 and  PSCl3. which in turn enjoy many applications in  herbicides,  insecticides,  plasticisers,  oil additives, and  flame retardants.For example oxidation of PCl3 gives  POCl3, which is used for the manufacture of  triphenyl phosphate and  tricresyl phosphate, which find application as  flame retardants and  plasticisers for  PVC. They are also used to make  insecticides such as  diazinon.  Phosphonates include the  herbicide  glyphosate,PCl3 is the precursor to  triphenylphosphine for the  Wittig reaction, and  phosphite esters which may be used as industrial intermediates, or used in the  Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, both important methods for making  alkenes. It can be used to make  trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), used as an  extraction agent, although TOPO is usually made via the corresponding phosphine.PCl3 is also used directly as a  reagent in  organic synthesis. It is used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into  alkyl chlorides, or  carboxylic acids into  acyl chlorides, although  thionyl chloride generally gives better yields than PCl3. Precautions
PCl3 is toxic, with a concentration of 600  ppm being lethal in just a few minutes. PCl3 is classified as  very toxic and  corrosive under EU  Directive 67/548/EEC, and the  risk phrases R14, R26/28, R35 and R48/20 are obligatory.

Phosphorus trichloride has a lone pair, and therefore can act as a  Lewis base, for example with the  Lewis acids BBr3 it forms a 1:1 adduct, Br3B−−+PCl3. Metal complexes such as Ni(PCl3)4 are known. This Lewis basicity is exploited in one useful route to organophosphorus compounds:
PCl3 +  RCl + AlCl3 → (RPCl3)+ −AlCl4
The (RPCl3)+ product can then be decomposed with water to produce an alkylphosphonic dichloride RP(=O)Cl2. Preparation
World production exceeds one-third of a million  tonnes. Phosphorus trichloride is prepared industrially by the reaction of chlorine with a  refluxing solution of white phosphorus in phosphorus trichloride, with continuous removal of PCl3 as it is formed.

Industrial production of phosphorus trichloride is controlled under the  Chemical Weapons Convention, where it is listed in  schedule 3.In the laboratory it may be more convenient to use the less toxic red phosphorus. It is sufficiently inexpensive that it would not be synthesized for laboratory use. Uses
PCl3 is important indirectly as a precursor to  PCl5,  POCl3 and  PSCl3. which in turn enjoy many applications in  herbicides,  insecticides,  plasticisers,  oil additives, and  flame retardants.For example oxidation of PCl3 gives  POCl3, which is used for the manufacture of  triphenyl phosphate and  tricresyl phosphate, which find application as  flame retardants and  plasticisers for  PVC. They are also used to make  insecticides such as  diazinon.  Phosphonates include the  herbicide  glyphosate,PCl3 is the precursor to  triphenylphosphine for the  Wittig reaction, and  phosphite esters which may be used as industrial intermediates, or used in the  Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, both important methods for making  alkenes. It can be used to make  trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), used as an  extraction agent, although TOPO is usually made via the corresponding phosphine.PCl3 is also used directly as a  reagent in  organic synthesis. It is used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into  alkyl chlorides, or  carboxylic acids into  acyl chlorides, although  thionyl chloride generally gives better yields than PCl3. Precautions
PCl3 is toxic, with a concentration of 600  ppm being lethal in just a few minutes. PCl3 is classified as  very toxic and  corrosive under EU  Directive 67/548/EEC, and the  risk phrases R14, R26/28, R35 and R48/20 are obligatory.

Phosphorus trichloride is the precursor to  organophosphorus compounds that contain one or more (P3+) atoms, most notably phosphites and phosphonates. These compounds do not usually contain the chlorine atoms found in PCl3.PCl3 reacts rapidly and  exothermically with  water to form  phosphorous acid, H3PO3 and HCl. A large number of similar substitution reactions are known, the most important of which is the formation of  phosphite esters by reaction with alcohols or  phenols. For example, with  phenol, triphenyl phosphite is formed:
3  PhOH + PCl3 →  P(OPh)3 + 3 HCl
where "Ph" stands for  phenyl group, -C6H5. Alcohols such as ethanol react similarly in the presence of a  base such as  triethylamine to give phosphite esters such as  triethyl phosphite ( ethyl is -C2H5):
3 C2H5OH + PCl3 → P(OC2H5)3 + 3 HCl
In the absence of base, however, the reaction affords a dialkyl  phosphonate and an  alkyl chloride, according to the following stoichiometry:
PCl3 + 3 C2H5OH → (C2H5O)2P(=O)H +  C2H5Cl + 2 HCl
 Amines, R2NH, form P(NR2)3, and  thiols (RSH) form P(SR)3. An industrially relevant reaction of PCl3 with amines is phosphonomethylation, which employs  formaldehyde:
R2NH + PCl3 + CH2O →  (HO)2P(O)CH2NR2 + 3 HCl

Phosphorus trichloride has a lone pair, and therefore can act as a  Lewis base, for example with the  Lewis acids BBr3 it forms a 1:1 adduct, Br3B−−+PCl3. Metal complexes such as Ni(PCl3)4 are known. This Lewis basicity is exploited in one useful route to organophosphorus compounds:
PCl3 +  RCl + AlCl3 → (RPCl3)+ −AlCl4
The (RPCl3)+ product can then be decomposed with water to produce an alkylphosphonic dichloride RP(=O)Cl2. Preparation
World production exceeds one-third of a million  tonnes. Phosphorus trichloride is prepared industrially by the reaction of chlorine with a  refluxing solution of white phosphorus in phosphorus trichloride, with continuous removal of PCl3 as it is formed.
P4 + 6 Cl2 → 4 PCl3
Industrial production of phosphorus trichloride is controlled under the  Chemical Weapons Convention, where it is listed in  schedule 3.In the laboratory it may be more convenient to use the less toxic red phosphorus. It is sufficiently inexpensive that it would not be synthesized for laboratory use. Uses
PCl3 is important indirectly as a precursor to  PCl5,  POCl3 and  PSCl3. which in turn enjoy many applications in  herbicides,  insecticides,  plasticisers,  oil additives, and  flame retardants.For example oxidation of PCl3 gives  POCl3, which is used for the manufacture of  triphenyl phosphate and  tricresyl phosphate, which find application as  flame retardants and  plasticisers for  PVC. They are also used to make  insecticides such as  diazinon.  Phosphonates include the  herbicide  glyphosate,PCl3 is the precursor to  triphenylphosphine for the  Wittig reaction, and  phosphite esters which may be used as industrial intermediates, or used in the  Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, both important methods for making  alkenes. It can be used to make  trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), used as an  extraction agent, although TOPO is usually made via the corresponding phosphine.PCl3 is also used directly as a  reagent in  organic synthesis. It is used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into  alkyl chlorides, or  carboxylic acids into  acyl chlorides, although  thionyl chloride generally gives better yields than PCl3. Precautions
PCl3 is toxic, with a concentration of 600  ppm being lethal in just a few minutes. PCl3 is classified as  very toxic and  corrosive under EU  Directive 67/548/EEC, and the  risk phrases R14, R26/28, R35 and R48/20 are obligatory.
