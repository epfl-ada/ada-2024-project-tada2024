 Phosphorus oxybromidePhosphorus trichloride Phosphorus pentachloride
Phosphoryl chloride (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a colourless liquid with the formula POCl3. It hydrolyses in moist air to  phosphoric acid to release choking fumes of  hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially on a large scale from phosphorus trichloride and oxygen or  phosphorus pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as  tricresyl phosphate.
 Structure
Like phosphate, phosphoryl chloride is tetrahedral in shape. It features three P-Cl bonds and one very strong P=O double bond, with an estimated  bond dissociation energy of 533.5 kJ/mol. On the basis of bond length and electronegativity, the Schomaker-Stevenson rule suggests that the double bond form is very dominant (in contrast with POF3). The P=O bond does not resemble the  π bond in a  carbonyl group as in a ketone. The appropriate description of the P-O interaction is a matter of long discussion. Older textbooks favour a description that invokes participation of the  d-orbitals on phosphorus. Some of these d-orbitals project toward the O atom, overlapping with  p-orbitals on oxygen. More modern texts seem to favour a description where the P-O  π bonding involves the sigma* components of the P-Cl bonds. These descriptions do not consider a role for d-orbitals.

 Chemical properties
POCl3 reacts with water and alcohols to give  phosphoric acid or  phosphate esters, respectively, for example
O=PCl3 + 3 H2O →  O=P(OH)3 + 3  HCl
If the water is replaced by an alcohol, the trialkyl phosphate esters result. Such reactions are often performed in the presence of an HCl acceptor such as  pyridine or an  amine. If POCl3 is heated with an excess of a  phenol ( ArOH) in the presence of a  Lewis acid catalyst such as  magnesium chloride a triaryl phosphate ester is formed, for example:
3  C6H5OH + O=PCl3 →  O=P(OC6H5)3 + 3  HCl
POCl3 can also act as a  Lewis base, forming  adducts with a variety of Lewis acids such as  titanium tetrachloride:
Cl3P+-O− + TiCl4 → Cl3P+-O-−TiCl4
The aluminium chloride adduct (POCl3·AlCl3) is quite stable, and so POCl3 can be used to remove AlCl3 completely from reaction mixtures at the end of a  Friedel-Crafts reaction. POCl3 reacts with  hydrogen bromide in the presence of AlCl3 to produce POBr3. Preparation
Phosphoryl chloride can be prepared by the reaction of phosphorus trichloride with oxygen at 20-50 °C (air is ineffective):2 PCl3 + O2 → 2 O=PCl3An alternative synthesis involves the reaction of  phosphorus pentachloride and  phosphorus pentoxide. Since these compounds are both solids, a convenient way of performing the reaction is to  chlorinate a mixture of PCl3 and P4O10, which generates the PCl5  in situ. As the PCl3 is consumed, the POCl3 becomes the reaction solvent.6 PCl3 + 6 Cl2 → 6  PCl5
6 PCl5 +  P4O10 → 10 POCl3Phosphorus pentachloride also forms POCl3 by reaction with water, but this reaction is less easily controlled than the above reaction. Uses
The most important use for phosphoryl chloride is in the manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as  triphenyl phosphate and  tricresyl phosphate. These esters have been used for many years as  flame retardants and  plasticisers for  PVC. Meanwhile trialkyl esters such as  tributyl phosphate (made similarly from  butan-1-ol) are used as  liquid-liquid extraction solvents in  nuclear reprocessing and elsewhere.In the laboratory, POCl3 is widely used as a dehydrating agent, for example the conversion of  amides to  nitriles. Similarly, certain cyclic amides can be cyclised to dihydro isoquinoline derivatives using the  Bischler-Napieralski reaction.


Such reactions are believed to go via an  imidoyl chloride; in certain cases where it is stable, the imidoyl chloride is the final product. For example  pyridones and pyrimidones can be converted to chloro- derivatives of  pyridines and  pyrimidines, which are important intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry. Likewise  barbituric acid is converted to 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine. by reaction with POCl3 at 140 °C.


Related to this chemistry is the use of POCl3 in acylation of activated  aromatic rings via the  Vilsmeier-Haack reaction to produce  aryl  aldehydes and  ketones. The reaction most often uses a formamide such as  DMF or N-phenyl-N-methylformamide, and it produces an iminium salt which is easily hydrolysed to the aldehyde upon workup. For example  anthracene gives 9-anthraldehyde:

For example  pyridones and pyrimidones can be converted to chloro- derivatives of  pyridines and  pyrimidines, which are important intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry. Likewise  barbituric acid is converted to 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine. by reaction with POCl3 at 140 °C.


Related to this chemistry is the use of POCl3 in acylation of activated  aromatic rings via the  Vilsmeier-Haack reaction to produce  aryl  aldehydes and  ketones. The reaction most often uses a formamide such as  DMF or N-phenyl-N-methylformamide, and it produces an iminium salt which is easily hydrolysed to the aldehyde upon workup. For example  anthracene gives 9-anthraldehyde:

 Preparation
Phosphoryl chloride can be prepared by the reaction of phosphorus trichloride with oxygen at 20-50 °C (air is ineffective):2 PCl3 + O2 → 2 O=PCl3An alternative synthesis involves the reaction of  phosphorus pentachloride and  phosphorus pentoxide. Since these compounds are both solids, a convenient way of performing the reaction is to  chlorinate a mixture of PCl3 and P4O10, which generates the PCl5  in situ. As the PCl3 is consumed, the POCl3 becomes the reaction solvent.6 PCl3 + 6 Cl2 → 6  PCl5
6 PCl5 +  P4O10 → 10 POCl3Phosphorus pentachloride also forms POCl3 by reaction with water, but this reaction is less easily controlled than the above reaction. Uses
The most important use for phosphoryl chloride is in the manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as  triphenyl phosphate and  tricresyl phosphate. These esters have been used for many years as  flame retardants and  plasticisers for  PVC. Meanwhile trialkyl esters such as  tributyl phosphate (made similarly from  butan-1-ol) are used as  liquid-liquid extraction solvents in  nuclear reprocessing and elsewhere.In the laboratory, POCl3 is widely used as a dehydrating agent, for example the conversion of  amides to  nitriles. Similarly, certain cyclic amides can be cyclised to dihydro isoquinoline derivatives using the  Bischler-Napieralski reaction.


Such reactions are believed to go via an  imidoyl chloride; in certain cases where it is stable, the imidoyl chloride is the final product. For example  pyridones and pyrimidones can be converted to chloro- derivatives of  pyridines and  pyrimidines, which are important intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry.
