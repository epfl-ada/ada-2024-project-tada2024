Potassium iodide is a white crystalline salt with  chemical formula KI, used in photography and radiation treatment. It finds widespread application as an iodide source because it is less  hygroscopic than  sodium iodide, making it easier to work with. KI can turn yellow upon heating in air or upon standing in moist air for long periods, because of  oxidation of the  iodide to iodine.
 Chemical properties
Potassium iodide behaves as a simple  ionic salt, K+I−. Since the  iodide ion is a mild  reducing agent, I− is easily oxidised to I2 by powerful  oxidising agents such as chlorine:2 KI( aq) + Cl2(aq) → 2  KCl + I2(aq)Even air will oxidize iodide as evidenced by the observation of a purple extract when KI is rinsed with  dichloromethane. Under acidic conditions, KI is oxidised even more easily, due to the formation of  hydroiodic acid (HI), which is a powerful reducing agent.KI forms  I3− when combined with elemental iodine.


KI(aq) + I2( s) → KI3(aq)

Unlike I2, I3− salts can be highly water-soluble. I2 and I3− have virtually identical redox potentials (0.535 and 0.536 V vs NHE, respectively), i.e. they are both mild oxidants relative to H2. Therefore, this reaction allows the iodine to be used in aqueous solutions for  redox  titrations.Potassium iodide also serves in some organic reactions as a source of iodide ion (see "uses" below). Preparation
Potassium iodide may be prepared by the reaction of a potassium base with  hydroiodic acid, for example: HI +  KHCO3 → KI +  H2O( l) + CO2(g)Alternatively iron(II) iodide, prepared using scrap iron and iodine (made from iodide rich  brines or from  Chile saltpeter, can be treated with  potassium carbonate: FeI2 +  K2CO3 → 2 KI +  FeCO3 Uses
Potassium iodide is used in photography, in the preparation of  silver(I) iodide for high speed  photographic film:KI( aq) +  AgNO3( aq) →  AgI( s) + KNO3( aq)Potassium iodide is also added to  table salt in small quantities to make it "iodized". In a saturated solution, it is also used as an  expectorant to treat lung congestion.KI is often used as a source of  iodide ion in  organic synthesis. A useful application is in the preparation of aryl iodides from  arenediazonium salts, for example:Saturated solution of potassium iodide is also used as treatment for  sporotrichosis, a fungal infection.In medical use, it can also serve as an antiseptic for people suffering from sore throat. The dose is 0.5g-1.0g in 100mL, with the accompany of iodine (0.5g-1.0g in 100mL). Role of potassium iodide in radiological emergency preparedness

Potassium iodide may also be used to protect the  thyroid from  radioactive iodine in the event of an accident or attack at a  nuclear power plant, or other  nuclear attack, especially where a  nuclear reactor is breached and the volatile radionuclides, which contain significant amount of  131I, are released into the environment. Radioiodine is a particularly dangerous radionuclide because the body concentrates it in the thyroid gland. Potassium iodide cannot protect against other causes of  radiation poisoning, however, nor can it provide any degree of protection against a  dirty bomb unless the bomb happens to contain a significant amount of  radioactive iodine. In case of a  nuclear emergency, iodine used for the cleaning of wounds should not be  ingested. It is a  poison.

Potassium iodide may also be used to protect the  thyroid from  radioactive iodine in the event of an accident or attack at a  nuclear power plant, or other  nuclear attack, especially where a  nuclear reactor is breached and the volatile radionuclides, which contain significant amount of  131I, are released into the environment. Radioiodine is a particularly dangerous radionuclide because the body concentrates it in the thyroid gland. Potassium iodide cannot protect against other causes of  radiation poisoning, however, nor can it provide any degree of protection against a  dirty bomb unless the bomb happens to contain a significant amount of  radioactive iodine. In case of a  nuclear emergency, iodine used for the cleaning of wounds should not be  ingested. It is a  poison.
