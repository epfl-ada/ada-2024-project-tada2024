Poultry is the class of  domesticated  fowl (birds) used for food or for their eggs. These most typically are members of the orders  Galliformes (such as chickens and  turkeys), and  Anseriformes ( waterfowl such as  ducks and  geese).The word poultry is often used to refer to the meat of these birds. In a more general sense, it may refer to the meat of other birds, such as pigeons or doves, or  game birds like  pheasants. Types of poultry

 Cuts of poultry
The meatiest parts of a bird are the  flight  muscles on its  chest, called breast meat, and the  walking muscles on the first and second segments of its  legs, called the thigh and drumstick respectively.In chickens and turkeys, the flight muscles, not adapted for sustained use, have less oxygen-carrying  myoglobin than the walking muscles, and are thus lighter in colour. This is the distinction between "white meat" and "dark meat". Waterfowl are adapted for sustained flight, and their breast meat is dark.  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Button_upper_letter.png
