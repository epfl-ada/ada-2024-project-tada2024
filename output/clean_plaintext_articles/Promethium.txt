Promethium ( IPA: /prə(ʊ)ˈmiːθiəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Pm and  atomic number 61.
 Notable characteristics
Promethium has one semi-stable isotope (145), it is a soft  beta emitter; it does not emit  gamma rays, but beta particles impinging on elements of high atomic numbers can generate  X-rays. Pure promethium exists in two  allotropic forms, and its chemistry is similar to other  lanthanides. Promethium salts luminesce in the dark with a pale blue or greenish glow due to their high radioactivity. Promethium can be found in traces in some uranium ores as a fission product. Applications
Uses for promethium include:
Beta radiation source for thickness gauges.Light source for signals that require reliable, independent operation (using  phosphor to absorb the beta radiation and produce light).In a  nuclear battery in which photocells convert the light into electric current, yielding a useful life of about five years using 147-Pm.Possibly in the future as a portable X-ray source, as an auxiliary heat or power source for space probes and satellites.
 History
The existence of promethium was first predicted by  Bohuslav Brauner in  1902; this prediction was supported by  Henry Moseley in  1914, who found a gap for a missing element which would have atomic number 61, but was unknown (however, Moseley of course had no sample of the element to verify this). Several groups claimed to have produced the element, but they could not confirm their discoveries because of the difficulty of separating promethium from other elements. Proof of the existence of promethium was obtained in  1945 by  Jacob A. Marinsky,  Lawrence E. Glendenin and  Charles D. Coryell during the analysis of byproducts of uranium fission; however, being too busy with defense-related research during World War II, they did not announce their discovery until  1947. The name promethium is derived from  Prometheus in Greek mythology, who stole the fire of the sky and gave it to mankind. The name was suggested by Grace Mary Coryell, Charles Coryell's wife, who felt that they were stealing fire from the gods.In  1963, ion-exchange methods were used to prepare about 10 grams of promethium from atomic reactor fuel processing wastes.Today, promethium is still recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission; it can also be produced by bombarding 146Nd with neutrons, turning it into 147Nd which decays into 147Pm through beta decay with a half-life of 11 days. Occurrence
Promethium can be formed as a product of uranium fission. Only trace amounts can be found in naturally occurring ores: a sample of  pitchblende has been found to contain promethium at a concentration of four parts per quintillion (1018) by mass.Promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star  HR 465 in  Andromeda, and possibly HD 101065 ( Przybylski's star) and HD 965.

 Isotopes
36  radioisotopes of promethium have been characterized, with the most stable being 145Pm with a  half-life of 17.7 years, 146Pm with a half-life of 5.53 years, and 147Pm with a half-life of 2.6234 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 364 days, and the majority of these have half lives that are less than 27 seconds. This element also has 11  meta states with the most stable being 148Pmm (T½ 41.29 days), 152Pmm2 (T½ 13.8 minutes) and 152Pmm (T½ 7.52 minutes).The isotopes of promethium range in  atomic weight from 127.9482600  u (128Pm) to 162.9535200 u (163Pm). The primary  decay mode before the longest-lived isotope, 145Pm, is  electron capture, and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 145Pm are neodymium (Nd) isotopes and the primary products after are samarium (Sm) isotopes. Precautions
Promethium must be handled with great care because of its high radioactivity. In particular, promethium can emit  X-rays during its  beta decay. Note that its half-life is less than that of plutonium-239 by a factor of multiple thousands to tens of thousands. Promethium has no biological role.

 Pm2O3

 Isotopes
36  radioisotopes of promethium have been characterized, with the most stable being 145Pm with a  half-life of 17.7 years, 146Pm with a half-life of 5.53 years, and 147Pm with a half-life of 2.6234 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 364 days, and the majority of these have half lives that are less than 27 seconds. This element also has 11  meta states with the most stable being 148Pmm (T½ 41.29 days), 152Pmm2 (T½ 13.8 minutes) and 152Pmm (T½ 7.52 minutes).The isotopes of promethium range in  atomic weight from 127.9482600  u (128Pm) to 162.9535200 u (163Pm). The primary  decay mode before the longest-lived isotope, 145Pm, is  electron capture, and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 145Pm are neodymium (Nd) isotopes and the primary products after are samarium (Sm) isotopes. Precautions
Promethium must be handled with great care because of its high radioactivity. In particular, promethium can emit  X-rays during its  beta decay. Note that its half-life is less than that of plutonium-239 by a factor of multiple thousands to tens of thousands. Promethium has no biological role.

 Occurrence
Promethium can be formed as a product of uranium fission. Only trace amounts can be found in naturally occurring ores: a sample of  pitchblende has been found to contain promethium at a concentration of four parts per quintillion (1018) by mass.Promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star  HR 465 in  Andromeda, and possibly HD 101065 ( Przybylski's star) and HD 965. Compounds

Chlorides 
 PmCl3
Bromides
