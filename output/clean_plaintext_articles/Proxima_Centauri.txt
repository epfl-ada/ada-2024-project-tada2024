The red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, part of the  Alpha Centauri star system, is the  nearest star to our Sun. As the name suggests, it is located in the constellation of  Centaurus. Proxima Centauri was discovered to share the same  proper motion as Alpha Centauri in  1915 by  Robert Innes while he was Director of the  Union Observatory in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was Innes who suggested the name Proxima. In  1917 at the  Royal Observatory,  Cape of Good Hope, the Dutch astronomer  J. Voûte measured the trigonometric  parallax and determined that Proxima was indeed at the same distance as Alpha Centauri, and hence was also the faintest star known at the time.
 Characteristics
Red dwarfs in general are far too faint to be observable with the naked eye, and Proxima Centauri is no exception. It has an  apparent magnitude of 11 while its  absolute magnitude is a very dim 15.5. Seen from  Alpha Centauri A or B, Proxima would be a 4.5 magnitude star.Based on the  parallax of 772.3 ± 2.4 milliarcseconds measured by  Hipparcos (and the more precise parallax determined using the  Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope of 768.7 ± 0.3 milliarcseconds), Proxima Centauri is roughly 4.2 light years from Earth, or 270,000 times more distant than the Sun. Its closest neighbors are  Alpha Centauri A and B (at 0.21 light years), the Sun, and  Barnard's Star (at 6.55 light years). From Earth's vantage point, Proxima is separated by 2° from  Alpha Centauri, or 4 times the angular diameter of the full Moon.In 2002,  VLTI used  optical interferometry to measure an angular diameter of 1.02 ± 0.08 milliarcsec for Proxima Centauri. Knowing its distance, the actual diameter can be determined to be about 1/7 that of the Sun, or 1.5 times that of  Jupiter. Its mass is also about 1/7 that of the Sun, or 150 times that of Jupiter.At a distance to Alpha Centauri of just 1/20th of Proxima Centauri's distance to the Sun, Proxima may actually be in orbit about Alpha, with an  orbital period on the order of 500,000 years or more. For this reason, Proxima is sometimes referred to as  Alpha Centauri C. However, it is possible that it may not actually be in orbit, although the association is unlikely to be entirely accidental as it shares approximately the same  motion through space as the larger star system  .Proxima, along with Alpha Centauri A and B, are among the "Tier 1" target stars for  NASA's  Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). SIM will be able to detect planets as small as three Earth-masses within two  Astronomical Units of a "Tier 1" target. Due to Proxima's small mass and distance, SIM would be able to detect even smaller planets around this star, should they exist. Traveling to Proxima Centauri
Proxima Centauri has been suggested as a logical first destination for  interstellar travel, although as a  flare star it would not be particularly hospitable. The current standard  spaceship, the  Space Shuttle, travels in orbit at 7.8 km/s. At that speed, it would take 160,000 years to reach Proxima. The fastest man-made spacecraft, the  Helios II deep space probe, has set a  speed record of 70.2 km/s. Even at that speed, the journey to Proxima Centauri would take 18,000 years. The proposed  VASIMR propulsion system, possibly able to achieve speeds up to 300 km/s, would shorten the journey to a "mere" 4,200 years —still firmly beyond the current  lifespan of both man and machine. It follows that  interstellar travel would require significant development of radical ideas to become feasible, such as hypothetical  generation ships, laser-pushed  solar sails,  nuclear fusion powered  Bussard ramjets,  nuclear pulse drives or  warp drives.
