It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.This small  passerine bird is a species found almost exclusively in  reedbeds, usually with some bushes. The 3-5  eggs are laid in a basket nest in  reeds. The chicks fledge after 10 or 11 days.Reed warblers are one of the species that are brood paracitised by the  common cuckoo.This is a medium-sized warbler, 12.5-14cm in length. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and buff underparts. The forehead is flattened, and the bill is strong and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are richer buff below. Like most warblers, it is  insectivorous, but will take other small food items including  berries.The song is a slow, chattering jit-jit-jit with typically acrocephaline whistles and mimicry added.
