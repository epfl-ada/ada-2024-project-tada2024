Rhenium ( IPA: /ˈɹiːniəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Re and  atomic number 75. A silvery-white, rare, heavy, polyvalent  transition metal, rhenium resembles manganese chemically and is used in some  alloys. Rhenium is obtained as a by-product of molybdenum refinement and rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconducting. This was the last naturally-occurring element to be discovered and belongs to the ten most expensive metals on Earth (over US$ 4000.-/kg).
 Notable characteristics
Rhenium is a silvery white metal, lustrous, and has one of the highest melting points of all elements, exceeded by only tungsten and carbon. It is also one of the most dense, exceeded only by platinum, iridium, and osmium. The  oxidation states of rhenium include -3,-1,+1,+2,+3,+4,+5,+6 and +7 oxidation states. The oxidation states +7,+6,+4,+2 and -1 are the most common.Its usual commercial form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated by pressing and resistance-sintering in a vacuum or hydrogen atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact shape that is in excess of 90 percent of the density of the metal. When  annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum  alloys are superconductive at 10  K; tungsten-rhenium  alloys are also superconductive, around 4-8  K depending on the alloy  . Applications
This element is used in platinum-rhenium  catalysts which in turn are primarily used in making lead-free, high-octane  gasoline and in high-temperature superalloys that are used to make jet engine parts. Other uses:
Widely used as filaments in  mass spectrographs and in  ion gauges.An additive to tungsten and molybdenum-based alloys to increase ductility in these alloys.Rhenium  catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.Electrical contact material due to its good wear resistance and ability to withstand arc corrosion. Thermocouples containing alloys of rhenium and tungsten are used to measure temperatures up to 2200 ° C.Rhenium wire is used in photoflash lamps in photography.
 History
Rhenium (Latin Rhenus meaning "Rhine") was the last naturally-occurring element to be discovered. The existence of an as-yet undiscovered element at this position in the periodic table had been predicted by  Henry Moseley in  1914. It is generally considered to have been discovered by  Walter Noddack,  Ida Tacke, and  Otto Berg in Germany. In  1925 they reported that they detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral  columbite. They also found rhenium in  gadolinite and  molybdenite. In 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of element by processing 660  kg of molybdenite.The process was so complicated and the cost so high that production was discontinued until early  1950 when tungsten-rhenium and molybdenum-rhenium alloys were prepared. These alloys found important applications in industry that resulted in a great demand for the rhenium produced from the molybdenite fraction of porphyry copper ores. Occurrence
Rhenium is not found free in nature, and it was only recently that the first rhenium mineral was found. In 1994,  Nature published a letter describing a rhenium sulfide mineral found condensing from a  fumarole on Russia's Kudriavy volcano. This is not an economically viable source of the element. Rhenium is widely spread through the Earth's crust at approximately 0.001  ppm.Commercial rhenium is extracted from molybdenum roaster-flue dusts obtained from copper-sulfide ores. Some molybdenum ores contain 0.002% to 0.2% rhenium. Total world production is between 40 and 50 tons/year; the main producers are in Chile, USA and Kazakhstan. Recycling of used Pt-Re catalyst and special alloys allow the recovery of another 10 tons/year.The metal form is prepared by reducing  ammonium perrhenate with hydrogen at high temperatures. Isotopes



Naturally occurring rhenium is a mix of 185Re, which is  stable, and 187Re, which is  unstable but has a very long  half-life. There are twenty-six other unstable isotopes recognized. Precautions
Little is known about rhenium toxicity so it should be handled with care. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhenium"
