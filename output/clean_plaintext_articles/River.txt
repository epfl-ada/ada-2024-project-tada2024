A river is a large natural  waterway. The source of a river may be a  lake, a  spring, or a collection of small streams, known as  headwaters. From their source, all rivers flow downhill, typically terminating in the ocean. The mouth, or lower end, of a river is known as its  base level.A river's water is confined to a  channel, made up of a  stream bed between  banks. Most rainfall on land passes through a river on its way to the ocean. Smaller side streams that join a river are  tributaries. The scientific term for any flowing natural waterway is a  stream; so in technical language, the term river is just a shorthand way to refer to a large stream. Rivers throughout history have been the source and support for civilization, and many major cities today are near a river of some sort.

Bridges are a popular way of crossing rivers, as seen here at the  Buller River,  West Coast, New Zealand


A river conducts water by constantly flowing perpendicular to the elevation curve of its bed, thereby converting the meander: start to form loops and snake through the plain by  eroding the river banks. Sometimes the river will cut off a loop, shortening the channel and forming an oxbow lake from the cut off section. Rivers that carry large amounts of  sediment develop conspicuous  deltas at their mouths. Rivers whose mouths are in saline tidal waters may form  estuaries.Over time, rivers cut away at their beds especially in the steeper headwater regions, eventually forming a more gentle gradient. Although the following classes are a useful simplified way to visualize rivers, it is important to recognize there are other factors at work here. Gradient is controlled largely by tectonics, but discharge is controlled largely by climate and sediment load is controlled by various factors including climate, geology in the headwaters, and the stream gradient.
Youthful river - a river with a steep gradient that has very few tributaries and flows quickly. Its channels erode deeper rather than wider.Mature river - a river with a gradient that is less steep than those of youthful rivers and flows more slowly than youthful rivers. A mature river is fed by many tributaries and has more discharge than a youthful river. Its channels erode wider rather than deeper.Old river - a river with a low gradient and low erosive energy. Old rivers are characterized by flood plains.Rejuvenated river - a river with a gradient that is raised by the earth's movement.
Where a river descends quickly over sloped topography,  rapids with  whitewater or even  waterfalls occur. Rapids are often used for recreational purposes (see  Whitewater kayaking). Waterfalls are sometimes used as sources of energy, via  watermills and  hydroelectric plants.

 The beginning of a mountain river (Reichenbach in  Grosse Scheidegg)




 The "mouth", where this river comes out of the melting ice (also visible in the previous photo)


Rivers begin at their  source in higher ground, either rising from a  spring, forming from glacial  meltwater, flowing from a body of water such as a  lake, or simply from damp, boggy places where the soil is  waterlogged. They end at their  base level where they flow into a larger body of water, the sea, a lake, or as a  tributary to another (usually larger) river. In  arid areas rivers sometimes end by losing water to  evaporation and percolation into dry,  porous material such as sand, soil, or  pervious rock. The area drained by a river and its tributaries is called its watershed, catchment basin or  drainage basin. (Watershed is also used however to mean a boundary between drainage basins.)Starting at the mouth of the river and following it upstream as it branches again and again, the resulting river network forms a dendritic (tree-like) structure that is an example of a natural random fractal. Geopolitical boundaries
Rivers have been important historically in determining political boundaries. For example, the Danube was a longstanding border of the Roman Empire, and today forms most of the border between Bulgaria and Romania. The Mississippi in North America, and the Rhine in Europe, are major east-west boundaries in those continents. The  Orange River forms the boundary between various provinces and countries along its route in Africa. Rating systems

 International Scale of River Difficulty - The scale is used to rate the challenges of navigation—particularly those with rapids. Class I is the easiest and Class VI is the hardest. Strahler Stream Order - The Strahler Stream Order is a method to rank rivers based on the connectivity and hierarchy of contributing tributaries. Headwaters are first order while the Amazon River is twelfth order. Approximately 80 percent of the rivers and streams on Earth are of the first and second order.
 Biology
The flora and fauna of rivers are much different from those of the ocean because the water is fresh (non-salty). Flooding
Flooding is a natural part of a river's cycles. Human activity, however, has upset the natural way flooding occurs by walling off rivers and straightening their courses. Removal of bogs, swamps and other  habitat. Today, many believe that the rebuilding of salmon runs is contingent upon reproducing the same environment shaped by logjams. In wintertime, rivers can be apart, it can lead to flash flooding downstream. Ice jams caused  flooding in the Northeastern United States Flow
A common misconception, particularly amongst schoolchildren and college students in North America, is that most, or even all, rivers flow from north to south. Rivers in fact flow downhill. Sometimes downhill is from north to south, but equally it can be from south to north, and usually is a complex meandering path involving all directions of the compass.Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of hydrology. Management
In its natural state a river can be managed or controlled to make them more useful and less disruptive to human activity.
Dams (see above) or  weirs may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy. Levees may be built to prevent run-off of excess river water in times of flood.Canals connect rivers to one another for water transfer or navigation.River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.
River management is an ongoing activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by man. Dredged channels silt up, sluice mechanisms deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. River lists

It is difficult to measure the length of a river, the more precise the measurement, the longer the river will seem. Also, it is difficult to determine where a river begins or ends, as very often, upstream rivers are formed by seasonal streams, swamps, or changing lakes.These are average measurements.

A river conducts water by constantly flowing perpendicular to the elevation curve of its bed, thereby converting the meander: start to form loops and snake through the plain by  eroding the river banks. Sometimes the river will cut off a loop, shortening the channel and forming an oxbow lake from the cut off section. Rivers that carry large amounts of  sediment develop conspicuous  deltas at their mouths. Rivers whose mouths are in saline tidal waters may form  estuaries.Over time, rivers cut away at their beds especially in the steeper headwater regions, eventually forming a more gentle gradient. Although the following classes are a useful simplified way to visualize rivers, it is important to recognize there are other factors at work here. Gradient is controlled largely by tectonics, but discharge is controlled largely by climate and sediment load is controlled by various factors including climate, geology in the headwaters, and the stream gradient.
Youthful river - a river with a steep gradient that has very few tributaries and flows quickly. Its channels erode deeper rather than wider.Mature river - a river with a gradient that is less steep than those of youthful rivers and flows more slowly than youthful rivers. A mature river is fed by many tributaries and has more discharge than a youthful river. Its channels erode wider rather than deeper.Old river - a river with a low gradient and low erosive energy. Old rivers are characterized by flood plains.Rejuvenated river - a river with a gradient that is raised by the earth's movement.
Where a river descends quickly over sloped topography,  rapids with  whitewater or even  waterfalls occur. Rapids are often used for recreational purposes (see  Whitewater kayaking). Waterfalls are sometimes used as sources of energy, via  watermills and  hydroelectric plants.

 The beginning of a mountain river (Reichenbach in  Grosse Scheidegg)




 The "mouth", where this river comes out of the melting ice (also visible in the previous photo)


Rivers begin at their  source in higher ground, either rising from a  spring, forming from glacial  meltwater, flowing from a body of water such as a  lake, or simply from damp, boggy places where the soil is  waterlogged. They end at their  base level where they flow into a larger body of water, the sea, a lake, or as a  tributary to another (usually larger) river. In  arid areas rivers sometimes end by losing water to  evaporation and percolation into dry,  porous material such as sand, soil, or  pervious rock. The area drained by a river and its tributaries is called its watershed, catchment basin or  drainage basin. (Watershed is also used however to mean a boundary between drainage basins.)Starting at the mouth of the river and following it upstream as it branches again and again, the resulting river network forms a dendritic (tree-like) structure that is an example of a natural random fractal. Geopolitical boundaries
Rivers have been important historically in determining political boundaries. For example, the Danube was a longstanding border of the Roman Empire, and today forms most of the border between Bulgaria and Romania. The Mississippi in North America, and the Rhine in Europe, are major east-west boundaries in those continents. The  Orange River forms the boundary between various provinces and countries along its route in Africa. Rating systems

 International Scale of River Difficulty - The scale is used to rate the challenges of navigation—particularly those with rapids. Class I is the easiest and Class VI is the hardest. Strahler Stream Order - The Strahler Stream Order is a method to rank rivers based on the connectivity and hierarchy of contributing tributaries. Headwaters are first order while the Amazon River is twelfth order. Approximately 80 percent of the rivers and streams on Earth are of the first and second order.
 Biology
The flora and fauna of rivers are much different from those of the ocean because the water is fresh (non-salty). Flooding
Flooding is a natural part of a river's cycles. Human activity, however, has upset the natural way flooding occurs by walling off rivers and straightening their courses. Removal of bogs, swamps and other  habitat. Today, many believe that the rebuilding of salmon runs is contingent upon reproducing the same environment shaped by logjams. In wintertime, rivers can be apart, it can lead to flash flooding downstream. Ice jams caused  flooding in the Northeastern United States Flow
A common misconception, particularly amongst schoolchildren and college students in North America, is that most, or even all, rivers flow from north to south. Rivers in fact flow downhill. Sometimes downhill is from north to south, but equally it can be from south to north, and usually is a complex meandering path involving all directions of the compass.Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of hydrology. Management
In its natural state a river can be managed or controlled to make them more useful and less disruptive to human activity.
Dams (see above) or  weirs may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy. Levees may be built to prevent run-off of excess river water in times of flood.Canals connect rivers to one another for water transfer or navigation.River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.
River management is an ongoing activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by man. Dredged channels silt up, sluice mechanisms deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. River lists

 The world's ten longest rivers
It is difficult to measure the length of a river, the more precise the measurement, the longer the river will seem. Also, it is difficult to determine where a river begins or ends, as very often, upstream rivers are formed by seasonal streams, swamps, or changing lakes.These are average measurements.

The flora and fauna of rivers are much different from those of the ocean because the water is fresh (non-salty). Flooding
Flooding is a natural part of a river's cycles. Human activity, however, has upset the natural way flooding occurs by walling off rivers and straightening their courses. Removal of bogs, swamps and other  habitat. Today, many believe that the rebuilding of salmon runs is contingent upon reproducing the same environment shaped by logjams. In wintertime, rivers can be apart, it can lead to flash flooding downstream. Ice jams caused  flooding in the Northeastern United States Flow
A common misconception, particularly amongst schoolchildren and college students in North America, is that most, or even all, rivers flow from north to south. Rivers in fact flow downhill. Sometimes downhill is from north to south, but equally it can be from south to north, and usually is a complex meandering path involving all directions of the compass.Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of hydrology. Management
In its natural state a river can be managed or controlled to make them more useful and less disruptive to human activity.
Dams (see above) or  weirs may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy. Levees may be built to prevent run-off of excess river water in times of flood.Canals connect rivers to one another for water transfer or navigation.River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.
River management is an ongoing activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by man. Dredged channels silt up, sluice mechanisms deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. River lists

 The world's ten longest rivers
It is difficult to measure the length of a river, the more precise the measurement, the longer the river will seem. Also, it is difficult to determine where a river begins or ends, as very often, upstream rivers are formed by seasonal streams, swamps, or changing lakes.These are average measurements.

Starting at the mouth of the river and following it upstream as it branches again and again, the resulting river network forms a dendritic (tree-like) structure that is an example of a natural random fractal. Geopolitical boundaries
Rivers have been important historically in determining political boundaries. For example, the Danube was a longstanding border of the Roman Empire, and today forms most of the border between Bulgaria and Romania. The Mississippi in North America, and the Rhine in Europe, are major east-west boundaries in those continents. The  Orange River forms the boundary between various provinces and countries along its route in Africa. Rating systems

Removal of bogs, swamps and other  habitat. Today, many believe that the rebuilding of salmon runs is contingent upon reproducing the same environment shaped by logjams. In wintertime, rivers can be apart, it can lead to flash flooding downstream. Ice jams caused  flooding in the Northeastern United States Flow
A common misconception, particularly amongst schoolchildren and college students in North America, is that most, or even all, rivers flow from north to south. Rivers in fact flow downhill. Sometimes downhill is from north to south, but equally it can be from south to north, and usually is a complex meandering path involving all directions of the compass.Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of hydrology. Management
In its natural state a river can be managed or controlled to make them more useful and less disruptive to human activity.
Dams (see above) or  weirs may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy. Levees may be built to prevent run-off of excess river water in times of flood.Canals connect rivers to one another for water transfer or navigation.River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.
River management is an ongoing activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by man. Dredged channels silt up, sluice mechanisms deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. River lists

 The world's ten longest rivers
It is difficult to measure the length of a river, the more precise the measurement, the longer the river will seem. Also, it is difficult to determine where a river begins or ends, as very often, upstream rivers are formed by seasonal streams, swamps, or changing lakes.These are average measurements.

 Flow
A common misconception, particularly amongst schoolchildren and college students in North America, is that most, or even all, rivers flow from north to south. Rivers in fact flow downhill. Sometimes downhill is from north to south, but equally it can be from south to north, and usually is a complex meandering path involving all directions of the compass.Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of hydrology. Management
In its natural state a river can be managed or controlled to make them more useful and less disruptive to human activity.
Dams (see above) or  weirs may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy. Levees may be built to prevent run-off of excess river water in times of flood.Canals connect rivers to one another for water transfer or navigation.River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.
River management is an ongoing activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by man. Dredged channels silt up, sluice mechanisms deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. River lists

 The world's ten longest rivers
It is difficult to measure the length of a river, the more precise the measurement, the longer the river will seem. Also, it is difficult to determine where a river begins or ends, as very often, upstream rivers are formed by seasonal streams, swamps, or changing lakes.These are average measurements.
