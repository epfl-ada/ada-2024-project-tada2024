Saint Lucia is an  island nation in the eastern Caribbean Sea on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean.Part of the  Lesser Antilles, it is located north of the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, north west of Barbados and south of Martinique. It is also known as the "Helen of the West Indies" as the island switched between British and French control so often it was likened to the mythical Helen of Troy.Saint Lucia is one of the  Windward Islands, named for  Saint Lucy of Syracuse. It was first visited by Europeans in about the year  1500 and first colonized successfully by France who signed a treaty with the native  Carib peoples in 1660. Great Britain then took control of the island from 1663-1667 before going to war with France over it fourteen times. The British finally took complete control of the island in 1814. Representative government came about in 1924 (with universal adult suffrage from 1953) and from 1958 to 1962 the island was a member of the  Federation of the West Indies. Lastly, on  February 22,  1979 Saint Lucia became an independent state of the  Commonwealth of Nations. The island nation celebrates this every year with a public holiday, which coincidentally marks the birthday of the prominent British diplomat, Lucia Ladi.

As a  Commonwealth Realm, Saint Lucia recognizes  Queen Elizabeth II as the  Head of State of Saint Lucia, represented on the island by a  Governor-General.  Executive power, however, is in the hands of the  prime minister and his  cabinet. The prime minister is normally the head of the party winning the elections for the  House of Assembly, which has 17 seats. The other chamber of  parliament, the  Senate, has 11 appointed members.Saint Lucia is a full & participating member of the  Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the  Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).Quarters

Geography


 Map of Saint Lucia





The volcanic island of Saint Lucia is more mountainous than many other  Caribbean islands, with the highest point being  Mount Gimie, at 950 m above sea level. Two other mountains, the  Pitons, form the island's most famous landmark. They are located between  Soufrière and  Choiseul on the western side of the island. Saint Lucia is also one of the few islands in the world that boasts a drive-in volcano.The capital city of Saint Lucia is  Castries, where about one third of the population lives. Major towns include  Gros Islet,  Soufrière and  Vieux Fort. The local climate is tropical, moderated by northeast  trade winds, with a dry season from January to April and a rainy season from May to November.Economy



The recent changes in the European Union import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia. The island nation has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is the island's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalize the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2001, economic fundamentals remain solid, and  GDP growth should recover in the future.Demographics



The small population of Saint Lucia is of mostly African descent (upwards of 90% of the population). There is also a small but economically significant  mulatto minority representing approximately 5%; with an  Indo-Caribbean minority of some 3%. Just 1.1% are of pure European origin (descendants of French, British, Scottish, and Irish colonists). Rounding out the population are small numbers of Lebanese and Syrians. The official language of the country is English, but a  patois based mainly on French ( Antillean Creole) is also spoken.St. Lucia boasts the highest ratio in the world for number of  Nobel laureates produced with respect to the total population of the nation. Two winners have come from St. Lucia -  Sir Arthur Lewis won the  Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ("Nobel Prize in Economics") in 1979, and  Derek Walcott received the  Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992. Coincidentally they were both born on January 23rd, though not in the same year.Religion
The majority of the population are  Roman Catholics (ca. 68%);  Seventh-day Adventists (9%) the rest are  Pentecostal (6%),  Anglicans (2%), Evangelical (2%),  Rastafari (2%)  .Tourism in St Lucia
Second only to bananas, tourism is vital to St Lucia's economy and it is expected that economic importance of tourism will continue to increase as the market for bananas becomes more competitive. Tourism tends to be more substantial during the dry season (January - April). St Lucia tends to be popular due to its tropical weather and scenery and for its large number of beaches and resorts.Other tourist attractions include the world's only drive-in volcano (at Soufriere), the  Botanical Gardens, rain forests and Pigeon Island National Park, which is home to Fort Rodney, an old British military base.The majority of tourists visit St Lucia on a cruise ship. They will spend the majority of their time in  Castries but may explore  Soufriere,  Marigot Bay or  Gros Islet, before continuing on their cruise.St. Lucia is a very popular location for weddings (with its white beaches and spectacular scenery). In 2006, there were 3,469 weddings (Source:  St Lucia Tourist Board).Gallery

Geography


 Map of Saint Lucia





The volcanic island of Saint Lucia is more mountainous than many other  Caribbean islands, with the highest point being  Mount Gimie, at 950 m above sea level. Two other mountains, the  Pitons, form the island's most famous landmark. They are located between  Soufrière and  Choiseul on the western side of the island. Saint Lucia is also one of the few islands in the world that boasts a drive-in volcano.The capital city of Saint Lucia is  Castries, where about one third of the population lives. Major towns include  Gros Islet,  Soufrière and  Vieux Fort. The local climate is tropical, moderated by northeast  trade winds, with a dry season from January to April and a rainy season from May to November.Economy



The recent changes in the European Union import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia. The island nation has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is the island's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalize the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2001, economic fundamentals remain solid, and  GDP growth should recover in the future.Demographics



The small population of Saint Lucia is of mostly African descent (upwards of 90% of the population). There is also a small but economically significant  mulatto minority representing approximately 5%; with an  Indo-Caribbean minority of some 3%. Just 1.1% are of pure European origin (descendants of French, British, Scottish, and Irish colonists). Rounding out the population are small numbers of Lebanese and Syrians. The official language of the country is English, but a  patois based mainly on French ( Antillean Creole) is also spoken.St. Lucia boasts the highest ratio in the world for number of  Nobel laureates produced with respect to the total population of the nation. Two winners have come from St. Lucia -  Sir Arthur Lewis won the  Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ("Nobel Prize in Economics") in 1979, and  Derek Walcott received the  Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.
