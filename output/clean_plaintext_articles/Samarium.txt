 Notable characteristics


 Samarium


Samarium is a rare earth metal, with a bright silver luster, that is reasonably stable in air; it ignites in air at 150 ° C. Three crystal modifications of the metal also exist, with transformations at 734 and 922 °C. Applications
Uses of Samarium include:
Carbon-arc lighting for the  motion picture industry (together with other rare earth metals).Doping CaF2 crystals for use in optical  masers or  lasers.As a  neutron absorber in  nuclear reactors.For alloys and headphones. Samarium-Cobalt magnets; SmCo5 is used in making a new permanent magnet material with the highest resistance to demagnetization of any known material, and an intrinsic coercive force as high as 2200 kA/m. Samarium(II) iodide is used as a  chemical reagent in  organic synthesis, for example in the  Barbier reaction.Samarium oxide is used in optical glass to absorb infrared light.Samarium compounds act as sensitizers for phosphors excited in the infrared.Samarium oxide is a  catalyst for the dehydration and  dehydrogenation of ethanol.Radioactive Samarium-153 is used in medicine to treat the severe pain associated with cancers that have spread to bone. The drug is called " Quadramet".
 History
Samarium was first discovered spectroscopically in  1853 by Swiss  chemist  Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac by its sharp  absorption lines in  didymium, and isolated in Paris in  1879 by French chemist  Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran from the mineral  samarskite ((Y,Ce,U,Fe)3(Nb,Ta,Ti)5O16).Like the mineral, Samarium was named after a  Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets (Василий Евграфович Самарский-Быховец, Vasilij Evgrafovič Samarskij-Byhovec - 1803-1870), who was from 1845 through 1861 the Chief of Staff (Colonel) of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers. He granted Rose to study the samples of the black mineral from  Ural mountains.Samarium is the first chemical element named after a person. Biological role
Samarium has no known biological role, but is said to stimulate the  metabolism. Occurrence
Samarium is never found free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is contained in many minerals, including  monazite,  bastnasite and  samarskite; monazite (in which it occurs up to an extent of 2.8%) and bastnasite are also used as commercial sources.  Misch metal containing about 1% of samarium has long been used, but it was not until recent years that relatively pure samarium has been isolated through  ion exchange processes,  solvent extraction techniques, and  electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of  samarium(III) chloride with  sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. Compounds
Compounds of Samarium include:
 Fluorides
 SmF2 SmF3
 Chlorides
 SmCl2 SmCl3
 Bromides
 SmBr2 SmBr3
 Iodides
 SmI2 SmI3
 Oxides
 Sm2O3
 Sulfides
 Sm2S3
 Selenides
 Sm2Se3
 Tellurides
 Sm2Te3

 Isotopes
Naturally occurring samarium is composed of 4 stable  isotopes, 144Sm, 150Sm, 152Sm and 154Sm, and 3  radioisotopes, 147Sm, 148Sm and 149Sm, with 152Sm being the most abundant (26.75%  natural abundance). 32  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being 148Sm with a  half-life of 7x1015 years, 149Sm with a half-life of more than 2x1015 years, and 147Sm with a half-life of 1.06x1011 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 1.04x108 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 48 seconds. This element also has 5  meta states with the most stable being 141mSm (t½ 22.6 minutes), 143m1Sm (t½ 66 seconds) and 139mSm (t½ 10.7 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 152Sm, is  electron capture, and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 152Sm are element Pm (promethium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element Eu (europium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, samarium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarium"

 Isotopes
Naturally occurring samarium is composed of 4 stable  isotopes, 144Sm, 150Sm, 152Sm and 154Sm, and 3  radioisotopes, 147Sm, 148Sm and 149Sm, with 152Sm being the most abundant (26.75%  natural abundance). 32  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being 148Sm with a  half-life of 7x1015 years, 149Sm with a half-life of more than 2x1015 years, and 147Sm with a half-life of 1.06x1011 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 1.04x108 years, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 48 seconds. This element also has 5  meta states with the most stable being 141mSm (t½ 22.6 minutes), 143m1Sm (t½ 66 seconds) and 139mSm (t½ 10.7 seconds).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 152Sm, is  electron capture, and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay. The primary  decay products before 152Sm are element Pm (promethium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element Eu (europium) isotopes. Precautions
As with the other lanthanides, samarium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarium"




Samarium is the first chemical element named after a person. Biological role
Samarium has no known biological role, but is said to stimulate the  metabolism. Occurrence
Samarium is never found free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is contained in many minerals, including  monazite,  bastnasite and  samarskite; monazite (in which it occurs up to an extent of 2.8%) and bastnasite are also used as commercial sources.  Misch metal containing about 1% of samarium has long been used, but it was not until recent years that relatively pure samarium has been isolated through  ion exchange processes,  solvent extraction techniques, and  electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of  samarium(III) chloride with  sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. Compounds
