Scelidosaurus (meaning 'limb lizard', from  Greek skelos/σκελος meaning 'leg' and saurus/σαυρος meaning 'lizard') was a  quadrupedal, heavily plated, plant-eating (herbivorous) dinosaur about 4 metres long. It lived during the Early Jurassic  Period and its fossils have been found in both England and in  Arizona, United States.
 Classification
Scelidosaurus was an  ornithischian and has been classified at different times as an  ankylosaur or  stegosaur. This debate is still ongoing, although it is now considered by most to be more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur. Despite its ankylosaur classification, it shared similarities with Stegosaurus, including a heavy body highest at the hips and bony plates down its back. Discovery and Species

Scelidosaurus was named by Sir  Richard Owen in 1859. While James Harrison of  Charmouth, England was quarrying the cliffs of Black Ven (between Charmouth and  Lyme Regis (possibly for raw material for the manufacture of  cement), in 1858, he found a few fragmentary fossils of limb bones. He sent them to Professor Richard Owen of the  Natural History Museum (originally the  British Museum (Natural History), London. These, with later finds from the same spot, revealed a near-complete skeleton.Scelidosaurus Species
