The term Severn crossing is used specifically to refer to two  motorway crossings over the  estuary of the River Severn between England and Wales, despite there being many other bridges upstream. The two crossings are:
The original  Severn Bridge ( Welsh: Pont Hafren)The  Second Severn Crossing (Welsh: Ail Groesfan Hafren)
The first motorway  suspension bridge was inaugurated on  8 September  1966, and the newer  cable-stayed bridge, a few  miles to the south, was inaugurated on  5 June  1996.The two Severn crossings are nowadays generally regarded (at least by people in the south of England and South Wales) as the main crossing points from England into Wales. Prior to 1966 road traffic between the southern counties of Wales and the southern counties of England – including London – either had to travel via  Gloucester or take the  Aust Ferry, which ran roughly along the line of the Severn Bridge, from Old Passage near  Aust to  Beachley. The ferry ramps at Old Passage and  Beachley are still visible.Tolls are collected on both crossings from vehicles travelling in a westward direction only. As of September 2006, the toll for a car is  £4.90.
 Railway crossing
The  Severn Tunnel, carrying mainline trains under the Severn, follows a very similar route to the Second Severn Crossing. The Future
The proposed  Severn Barrage will constitute a third crossing if it is ever built. It is generally presumed that it would carry a road crossing. Until recently, a rail link over it had been ruled out because the barrage would contain a huge set of shipping locks that the rails would need to traverse. However, it has been suggested that a rail bridge could carry smaller, modern trains over the locks, so a rail link is possible. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_crossing"
