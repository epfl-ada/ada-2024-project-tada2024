The common sorrel , or spinach dock , is a perennial herb, which grows abundantly in meadows in most parts of Europe and is cultivated as a leaf vegetable.
In the Caribbean, sorrel typically refers to Jamaican Red Sorrel ( Hibiscus sabdariffa ). A popular sorrel beverage is widely consumed which is dark red, and has a sweet, spiced flavor. The deep red coloured annual is also used in making tarts and jellies. The fibre is also used by craftspeople.
Common sorrel is a slender plant about 60 cm high, with juicy stems and leaves. It has whorled spikes of reddish-green flowers , which bloom in June and July. The leaves are oblong, the lower ones being 7 to 15 cm in length, slightly arrow-shaped at the base, with very long petioles. The upper ones are sessile, and frequently become crimson.
As the flowers increase in size, they become a purplish colour. The stamens and pistils are on different plants. The seeds , when ripe, are brown and shining. The perennial roots run deeply into the ground.
The leaves of sorrel are eaten by the larvae of several species of Lepidoptera including blood-vein.
Common sorrel has been cultivated for centuries, although its popularity has decreased considerably over time. The edible leaves have a flavor that is very similar to that of kiwifruit (Chinese Gooseberry), or sour wild strawberries. Because of the mildly acidic taste, some say that it quenches thirst, and consider it helpful in boosting the appetite. The leaves may be added to salads to sharpen the taste. They are often pur√©ed in soups and sauces and is the characteristic ingredient in shav. The plant contains oxalic acid, which contributes to its characteristic flavor, and so may be contraindicated in people with rheumatic-type complaints, kidney or bladder stones, and the like. It is also a laxative.
