The Southern Rockhopper Penguin or just Rockhopper Penguin, Eudyptes chrysocome, is a  species of penguin closely related to the  Macaroni Penguin.This is the smallest yellow-crested, black-and-white penguin, reaching a length of 55 cm. It has slate-grey upperparts and a straight, bright yellow eyebrow ending in long yellowish plumes projecting sideways behind a red eye. It breeds in colonies, from sea-level to cliff-tops, and sometimes inland. It feeds on krill,  squid,  octopus, fish,  molluscs,  plankton,  cuttlefish and crustaceans.The Rockhopper Penguins have a global population of about 3.5 million pairs. The nominate subspecies chrysocome breeds on the Falkland Islands, and on islands off Argentina and southern Chile. The subspecies moseleyi, possibly a distinct species (as  Northern Rockhopper Penguin, E. moseleyi) breeds on islands in  Tristan da Cunha, and  Amsterdam and  St Paul Islands. The subspecies filholi breeds on the  Prince Edward Islands, the  Crozet Islands, the  Kerguelen Islands,  Heard Island,  Macquarie Island, and  Campbell, New Zealand and  Antipodes Islands.The status of this species is vulnerable due to a fall of 24% in its population in the last thirty years.As their name suggests, they spend their time hopping over rocks, and the  explorers who discovered them were amused to see the penguins jumping all over the place. The scientific name for the Rockhopper penguin is sometimes given as Eudyptes crestatus.
