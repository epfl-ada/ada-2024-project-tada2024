Stefan Bengt Edberg (born  January 19,  1966 in  Västervik, Sweden) is a former  World No. 1 professional tennis player (in both singles and doubles play) from Sweden. During his career, he won six Grand Slam singles titles and three Grand Slam doubles titles. Edberg is well known as one of the best  serve and volley players of all time, for his superb  volleying skills, and as a gentleman and ambassador for the sport.
 Career
Edberg first came to the tennis world's attention as a junior player. He won all four of the Grand Slam junior titles in  1983 to become the first-ever player to achieve the "Junior Grand Slam."As a professional, Edberg won his first career doubles title in Basel in 1983 and his first top-level singles title at Milan in  1984.Edberg's first two Grand Slam singles titles came at the Australian Open. In  1985, he defeated  Mats Wilander in straight sets to claim his first major title. Two years later, he beat Pat Cash in five sets to win the last Australian Open held on grass courts. Edberg also won the Australian Open and  U.S. Open men's doubles titles in 1987 (partnering fellow-Swede  Anders Järryd).In  1988, Edberg reached the first of three consecutive finals at  Wimbledon. In all three finals, he played Boris Becker. Edberg won their first encounter in a four-set match spread over three days because of rain delays. A year later, Becker won in straight sets. The closest of their matches came in the  1990 final, when Edberg won in five sets.Edberg claimed the World No. 1 ranking in August 1990 by winning the  Cincinnati Masters. He held it for the rest of that year and for much of  1991 and  1992.Edberg's final two Grand Slam singles triumphs came at the U.S. Open, with wins over  Jim Courier in the 1991 final and Pete Sampras in the 1992 final, who was just months away from being ranked No. 1 in the world.Edberg's last Grand Slam singles final appearances were at the Australian Open, where he lost in four sets to Jim Courier in both 1992 and  1993.In  1996, Edberg won his third Grand Slam doubles title at Australian Open with  Petr Korda.The only Grand Slam singles title Edberg never won was the  French Open. He reached the French Open final in 1989 but lost in five sets to 17-year old  Michael Chang, who became the youngest ever male winner of a Grand Slam singles title.Edberg was most comfortable playing tennis on fast-playing surfaces. Of his six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on  grass courts at the Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) and two were won on  hardcourts at the US Open (1991 and 1992).Edberg also played on four Swedish Davis Cup winning teams in 1984, 1985, 1987, and  1994. He appeared in seven Davis Cup finals—a record for a Swedish player.Edberg was also a member of the Swedish teams that won the  World Team Cup in 1988, 1991, and  1995.At the  1984 Olympic Games in  Los Angeles, where tennis was a demonstration sport, Edberg won the men's singles gold medal. Four years later, at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, tennis became a full medal sport and Edberg won bronze medals in both the men's singles and the men's doubles.During his career, Edberg won a total of 42 top-level singles titles and 18 doubles titles and appeared in a then record 54 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments (broken by  Wayne Ferreira). He was ranked the World No. 1 for a total of 72 weeks. Edberg was also a five-time recipient of the  Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) Sportsmanship Award (1988-90, 1992, and 1995). In recognition of this achievement, the ATP renamed the award the "Edberg Sportsmanship Award" in  1996. In  2004, Edberg was inducted into the  International Tennis Hall of Fame in  Newport, Rhode Island,  USA. Trivia

Edberg won singles titles in 12 different countries: Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,  The Netherlands, Qatar, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.Edberg was awarded the  Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in  1990.Edberg was involved in a freak accident during the boys' singles final at the 1983 US Open, when Richard Wertheim, a linesman, was struck in the groin by a ball struck by Edberg. Wertheim fell backwards, fracturing his skull, and died in hospital shortly thereafter.

"If he hadn't lived," Edberg later said of Van Allen, "Michael and I might still be out there playing!"
Background :  Jimmy Van Allen (famed for his invention of the tennis tiebreak) died on the same day in 1991 that  Michael Stich narrowly defeated Edberg in a Wimbledon semifinal 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(2) where Edberg did not lose his serve.

Edberg first came to the tennis world's attention as a junior player. He won all four of the Grand Slam junior titles in  1983 to become the first-ever player to achieve the "Junior Grand Slam."As a professional, Edberg won his first career doubles title in Basel in 1983 and his first top-level singles title at Milan in  1984.Edberg's first two Grand Slam singles titles came at the Australian Open. In  1985, he defeated  Mats Wilander in straight sets to claim his first major title. Two years later, he beat Pat Cash in five sets to win the last Australian Open held on grass courts. Edberg also won the Australian Open and  U.S. Open men's doubles titles in 1987 (partnering fellow-Swede  Anders Järryd).In  1988, Edberg reached the first of three consecutive finals at  Wimbledon. In all three finals, he played Boris Becker. Edberg won their first encounter in a four-set match spread over three days because of rain delays. A year later, Becker won in straight sets. The closest of their matches came in the  1990 final, when Edberg won in five sets.Edberg claimed the World No. 1 ranking in August 1990 by winning the  Cincinnati Masters. He held it for the rest of that year and for much of  1991 and  1992.Edberg's final two Grand Slam singles triumphs came at the U.S. Open, with wins over  Jim Courier in the 1991 final and Pete Sampras in the 1992 final, who was just months away from being ranked No. 1 in the world.Edberg's last Grand Slam singles final appearances were at the Australian Open, where he lost in four sets to Jim Courier in both 1992 and  1993.In  1996, Edberg won his third Grand Slam doubles title at Australian Open with  Petr Korda.The only Grand Slam singles title Edberg never won was the  French Open. He reached the French Open final in 1989 but lost in five sets to 17-year old  Michael Chang, who became the youngest ever male winner of a Grand Slam singles title.Edberg was most comfortable playing tennis on fast-playing surfaces. Of his six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on  grass courts at the Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) and two were won on  hardcourts at the US Open (1991 and 1992).Edberg also played on four Swedish Davis Cup winning teams in 1984, 1985, 1987, and  1994. He appeared in seven Davis Cup finals—a record for a Swedish player.Edberg was also a member of the Swedish teams that won the  World Team Cup in 1988, 1991, and  1995.At the  1984 Olympic Games in  Los Angeles, where tennis was a demonstration sport, Edberg won the men's singles gold medal. Four years later, at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, tennis became a full medal sport and Edberg won bronze medals in both the men's singles and the men's doubles.During his career, Edberg won a total of 42 top-level singles titles and 18 doubles titles and appeared in a then record 54 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments (broken by  Wayne Ferreira). He was ranked the World No. 1 for a total of 72 weeks. Edberg was also a five-time recipient of the  Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) Sportsmanship Award (1988-90, 1992, and 1995). In recognition of this achievement, the ATP renamed the award the "Edberg Sportsmanship Award" in  1996. In  2004, Edberg was inducted into the  International Tennis Hall of Fame in  Newport, Rhode Island,  USA. Trivia

Edberg won singles titles in 12 different countries: Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,  The Netherlands, Qatar, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.Edberg was awarded the  Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in  1990.Edberg was involved in a freak accident during the boys' singles final at the 1983 US Open, when Richard Wertheim, a linesman, was struck in the groin by a ball struck by Edberg. Wertheim fell backwards, fracturing his skull, and died in hospital shortly thereafter.

"If he hadn't lived," Edberg later said of Van Allen, "Michael and I might still be out there playing!"
Background :  Jimmy Van Allen (famed for his invention of the tennis tiebreak) died on the same day in 1991 that  Michael Stich narrowly defeated Edberg in a Wimbledon semifinal 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(2) where Edberg did not lose his serve.

 Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"




In  1996, Edberg won his third Grand Slam doubles title at Australian Open with  Petr Korda.The only Grand Slam singles title Edberg never won was the  French Open. He reached the French Open final in 1989 but lost in five sets to 17-year old  Michael Chang, who became the youngest ever male winner of a Grand Slam singles title.Edberg was most comfortable playing tennis on fast-playing surfaces. Of his six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on  grass courts at the Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) and two were won on  hardcourts at the US Open (1991 and 1992).Edberg also played on four Swedish Davis Cup winning teams in 1984, 1985, 1987, and  1994. He appeared in seven Davis Cup finals—a record for a Swedish player.Edberg was also a member of the Swedish teams that won the  World Team Cup in 1988, 1991, and  1995.At the  1984 Olympic Games in  Los Angeles, where tennis was a demonstration sport, Edberg won the men's singles gold medal. Four years later, at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, tennis became a full medal sport and Edberg won bronze medals in both the men's singles and the men's doubles.During his career, Edberg won a total of 42 top-level singles titles and 18 doubles titles and appeared in a then record 54 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments (broken by  Wayne Ferreira). He was ranked the World No. 1 for a total of 72 weeks. Edberg was also a five-time recipient of the  Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) Sportsmanship Award (1988-90, 1992, and 1995). In recognition of this achievement, the ATP renamed the award the "Edberg Sportsmanship Award" in  1996. In  2004, Edberg was inducted into the  International Tennis Hall of Fame in  Newport, Rhode Island,  USA. Trivia

Edberg won singles titles in 12 different countries: Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,  The Netherlands, Qatar, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.Edberg was awarded the  Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in  1990.Edberg was involved in a freak accident during the boys' singles final at the 1983 US Open, when Richard Wertheim, a linesman, was struck in the groin by a ball struck by Edberg.

"If he hadn't lived," Edberg later said of Van Allen, "Michael and I might still be out there playing!"
Background :  Jimmy Van Allen (famed for his invention of the tennis tiebreak) died on the same day in 1991 that  Michael Stich narrowly defeated Edberg in a Wimbledon semifinal 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(2) where Edberg did not lose his serve.

 Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"




Edberg was most comfortable playing tennis on fast-playing surfaces. Of his six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on  grass courts at the Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) and two were won on  hardcourts at the US Open (1991 and 1992).Edberg also played on four Swedish Davis Cup winning teams in 1984, 1985, 1987, and  1994. He appeared in seven Davis Cup finals—a record for a Swedish player.Edberg was also a member of the Swedish teams that won the  World Team Cup in 1988, 1991, and  1995.At the  1984 Olympic Games in  Los Angeles, where tennis was a demonstration sport, Edberg won the men's singles gold medal. Four years later, at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, tennis became a full medal sport and Edberg won bronze medals in both the men's singles and the men's doubles.During his career, Edberg won a total of 42 top-level singles titles and 18 doubles titles and appeared in a then record 54 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments (broken by  Wayne Ferreira). He was ranked the World No. 1 for a total of 72 weeks. Edberg was also a five-time recipient of the  Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) Sportsmanship Award (1988-90, 1992, and 1995). In recognition of this achievement, the ATP renamed the award the "Edberg Sportsmanship Award" in  1996. In  2004, Edberg was inducted into the  International Tennis Hall of Fame in  Newport, Rhode Island,  USA. Trivia

Edberg won singles titles in 12 different countries: Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,  The Netherlands, Qatar, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.Edberg was awarded the  Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in  1990.Edberg was involved in a freak accident during the boys' singles final at the 1983 US Open, when Richard Wertheim, a linesman, was struck in the groin by a ball struck by Edberg. Wertheim fell backwards, fracturing his skull, and died in hospital shortly thereafter.

"If he hadn't lived," Edberg later said of Van Allen, "Michael and I might still be out there playing!"
Background :  Jimmy Van Allen (famed for his invention of the tennis tiebreak) died on the same day in 1991 that  Michael Stich narrowly defeated Edberg in a Wimbledon semifinal 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(2) where Edberg did not lose his serve.
