T.D. Judah was the name of a 4-2-2 steam locomotive owned by the  Central Pacific Railroad. It was named in honour of the railroad's first chief engineer,  Theodore Dehone Judah, who surveyed a passable route over the  Sierra Nevada Mountains for the  Transcontinental Railroad. History and career
Like its sister engine,  C.P. Huntington, T.D. Judah was originally built by the  Cooke Locomotive Works in early  1863 for a railroad that was unable to pay for it. Later, the two were seen in the Cooke shops by  Collis Huntington and purchased for use on the  Central Pacific Railroad (CP), becoming the road's third and fourth locomotives respectively. Two other, larger engines,  Gov. Stanford (number 1, built by  Norris Locomotive Works) and Pacific (number 2, built by  Mason Machine Works) had been purchased earlier.Having originally been a 4-2-4T (T for tank), in 1872, the engine was rebuilt as a 4-2-2 with separate tender and may have been given other mechanical upgrades like its sister engine. The rebuild reduced the locomotive's overall weight to 30,000 lb., with 15,000 lb. on the drivers.T.D. Judah was sold to the Wellington Colliery Company on  Vancouver Island,  British Columbia, Canada, where it found service as Wellington Colliery Railway's Queen Anne. It was subsequently scrapped in 1912. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._D._Judah"
