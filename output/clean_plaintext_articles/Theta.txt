Theta (uppercase Θ, lowercase θ) is the eighth letter of the  Greek alphabet, derived from the Phoenician letter  Teth. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 9. In  Classical Greek θ represented an  aspirated  voiceless dental plosive (/tʰ/), but in Koiné and later dialects it became a  voiceless dental fricative /θ/. In American English, the name of the letter is commonly pronounced [θeɪɾə]. In  Modern Greek and British English, the name is pronounced [θiːtə].Letters such as the early Cyrillic letter fita (Ѳ, ѳ) developed from θ.In its  archaic form, θ was written as:
a cross within a circle ( or )

and later, as a line or point within a circle ( or ).
According to  Porphyry of Tyros, the Egyptians used an X within a circle as a  symbol of the soul; having a value of nine, it was used as a symbol for  Ennead.  Johannes Lydus says that the  Egyptians used a symbol for  Kosmos in the form of theta, with a fiery circle representing the world, and a snake spanning the middle representing  Agathos Daimon. The Egyptians also used the symbol of a point within a circle (, the sun disc) to represent the sun, which might be a possible origin of its use as the Sun's  astrological glyph. It is worthwhile to note that θῆτα (theta) has the same numerical value in  isopsephy as Ηλιος ( Helios): 318.In classical Athens, it was used as an abbreviation for the  Greek θάνατος (thanatos, "death") and as it vaguely resembles a human skull, theta was used as a warning symbol of  death, in the same way that  skull and crossbones are used in modern times. It survives on  potsherds used by Athenians when voting for the  death penalty. 
 Symbol
The lower-case letter θ is used as a symbol for:
A  plane angle in geometry.The  voiceless dental fricative in the  International Phonetic Alphabet, such as in the words thick or thin (but not as in the, which is the  voiced dental fricative).The  Potential temperature in meteorology.
The upper-case letter Θ is used as a symbol for:
Dimensionless temperature in  transport phenomena. Big O notation. Denoting an asymptotically tight bound in analysis of algorithms. Θ (set theory), a certain ordinal number.Representing  pentaquarks, exotic  baryons in  particle physics. Earth Day. Brainwave Frequency (Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta) ranging from 4-8 Hz

Theta is known as an option greek measuring the rate of time decay on a daily basis. One can look as this as an ice cube melting in your hand. A Theta of -.05 means that the option is losing a nickle of time value each day. Other option greeks include Delta, Vega, Rho and Gamma.
