Thorium ( IPA: /ˈθɔːriəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Th and  atomic number 90. As a naturally occurring, slightly radioactive metal, it has been considered as an alternative nuclear fuel to uranium.
 Notable characteristics
When pure, thorium is a silvery white metal that retains its lustre for several months. However, when it is contaminated with the oxide, thorium slowly tarnishes in air, becoming grey and eventually black.  Thorium dioxide (ThO2), also called thoria, has one of the highest melting points of all oxides (3300°C). When heated in air, thorium metal  turnings ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light.See  Actinides in the environment for details of the environmental aspects of thorium. Applications
Applications of thorium:
As an  alloying element in magnesium, imparting high  strength and  creep resistance at elevated temperatures.Thorium is used to coat tungsten wire used in electronic equipment, improving the electron  emission of heated  cathodes.Thorium has been used in gas tungsten arc welding electrodes and  heat-resistant  ceramics. Uranium-thorium age dating has been used to date hominid fossils.As a  fertile material for producing  nuclear fuel. In particular, the proposed  energy amplifier reactor design would employ thorium. Since thorium is more abundant than uranium, some designs of  nuclear reactor incorporate thorium in their  nuclear fuel cycle.Thorium is a very effective  radiation shield, although it has not been used for this purpose as much as have lead or  depleted uranium.Thorium may be used in  subcritical reactors instead of uranium as fuel. This produces less waste and cannot melt down.
Applications of  thorium dioxide (ThO2):
 Mantles in portable gas lights. These mantles glow with a dazzling light (unrelated to radioactivity) when heated in a gas flame.Used to control the grain size of tungsten used for electric lamps.Used for high-temperature laboratory  crucibles.Added to glass, it helps create glasses of a high  refractive index and with low  dispersion. Consequently, they find application in high-quality  lenses for cameras and scientific instruments.Has been used as a  catalyst: 
In the conversion of ammonia to  nitric acid.In petroleum  cracking.In producing sulfuric acid.
Thorium dioxide is the active ingredient of  Thorotrast, which was used as part of  X-ray diagnostics. This use has been abandoned due to the  carcinogenic nature of Thorotrast.
 History
Thorium was discovered in 1828 by the Swedish chemist  Jöns Jakob Berzelius, who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. The metal had virtually no uses until the invention of the lantern mantle in 1885.The  crystal bar process (or Iodide process) was discovered by  Anton Eduard van Arkel and  Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925 to produce high-purity metallic thorium.The name ionium was given early in the study of radioactive elements to the 230Th  isotope produced in the  decay chain of  238U before it was realized that ionium and thorium were chemically identical. The symbol Io was used for this supposed element. Occurrence


 Monazite, a rare-earth-and-thorium-phosphate mineral is the primary source of the world's thorium


Thorium is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils, where it is about three times more abundant than uranium, and is about as common as lead. Soil commonly contains an average of around 12 parts per million (ppm) of thorium. Thorium occurs in several minerals, the most common being the rare earth-thorium-phosphate mineral,  monazite, which contains up to about 12% thorium oxide. There are substantial deposits in several countries. 232Th decays very slowly (its  half-life is about three times the age of the earth) but other thorium  isotopes occur in the thorium and uranium decay chains. Most of these are short-lived and hence much more radioactive than 232Th, though on a mass basis they are negligible. Thorium as a nuclear fuel
Thorium, as well as uranium and plutonium, can be used as fuel in a  nuclear reactor. Although not  fissile itself, 232Th will absorb  slow neutrons to produce uranium-233 (233U), which is fissile. Hence, like 238U, it is fertile. In one significant respect 233U is better than the other two fissile isotopes used for nuclear fuel, 235U and plutonium-239 (239Pu), because of its higher neutron yield per neutron absorbed. Given a start with some other fissile material (235U or 239Pu), a breeding cycle similar to, but more efficient than that currently possible with the 238U-to-239Pu cycle (in  slow-neutron reactors), can be set up. The 232Th absorbs a neutron to become 233Th which normally decays to protactinium-233 (233Pa) and then 233U. The irradiated fuel can then be unloaded from the reactor, the 233U separated from the thorium (a relatively simple process since it involves chemical instead of isotopic separation), and fed back into another reactor as part of a closed  nuclear fuel cycle.Problems include the high cost of fuel fabrication due partly to the high radioactivity of 233U which is a result of its contamination with traces of the short-lived 232U; the similar problems in recycling thorium due to highly radioactive 228Th; some weapons proliferation risk of 233U; and the technical problems (not yet satisfactorily solved) in reprocessing. Much development work is still required before the thorium fuel cycle can be commercialised, and the effort required seems unlikely while (or where) abundant uranium is available.Nevertheless, the  thorium fuel cycle, with its potential for breeding fuel without the need for  fast neutron reactors, holds considerable potential long-term. Thorium is significantly more abundant than uranium, so it is a key factor in the sustainability of nuclear energy.Australia and India have particularly large reserves of thorium. India has planned its nuclear power program to eventually use thorium exclusively, phasing out uranium as an input material. This ambitious plan uses both fast and thermal  breeder reactors. The  Advanced Heavy Water Reactor and  KAMINI reactor are efforts in this direction.The current thorium mineral reserve estimates (in tons)

 Isotopes
Naturally occurring thorium is composed of one  isotope:  232Th. Twenty seven  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most {abundant and/or stable} being 232Th with a  half-life of 14.05 billion years, 230Th with a half-life of 75,380 years, 229Th with a half-life of 7340 years, and 228Th with a half-life of 1.92 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than ten minutes. This element also has one  meta state.The known isotopes of thorium range in  atomic weight from 210  amu (210Th) to 236 amu (236Th). Precautions
Powdered thorium metal is often  pyrophoric and should be handled carefully.Exposure to aerosolized thorium can lead to increased risk of cancers of the  lung,  pancreas and  blood. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of  liver diseases. This element has no known biological role. See also  Thorotrast. In popular culture
 David Hahn, the so-called "radioactive boy scout," bombarded thorium from lantern mantles with neutrons to produce small quantities of fissionable material in his backyard. He had to abandon his project when he began to detect elevated radiation levels several houses away from his own. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"

 Isotopes
Naturally occurring thorium is composed of one  isotope:  232Th. Twenty seven  radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most {abundant and/or stable} being 232Th with a  half-life of 14.05 billion years, 230Th with a half-life of 75,380 years, 229Th with a half-life of 7340 years, and 228Th with a half-life of 1.92 years. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lifes that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than ten minutes. This element also has one  meta state.The known isotopes of thorium range in  atomic weight from 210  amu (210Th) to 236 amu (236Th). Precautions
Powdered thorium metal is often  pyrophoric and should be handled carefully.Exposure to aerosolized thorium can lead to increased risk of cancers of the  lung,  pancreas and  blood. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of  liver diseases. This element has no known biological role. See also  Thorotrast. In popular culture
 David Hahn, the so-called "radioactive boy scout," bombarded thorium from lantern mantles with neutrons to produce small quantities of fissionable material in his backyard.

Applications of thorium:
As an  alloying element in magnesium, imparting high  strength and  creep resistance at elevated temperatures.Thorium is used to coat tungsten wire used in electronic equipment, improving the electron  emission of heated  cathodes.Thorium has been used in gas tungsten arc welding electrodes and  heat-resistant  ceramics. Uranium-thorium age dating has been used to date hominid fossils.As a  fertile material for producing  nuclear fuel. In particular, the proposed  energy amplifier reactor design would employ thorium. Since thorium is more abundant than uranium, some designs of  nuclear reactor incorporate thorium in their  nuclear fuel cycle.Thorium is a very effective  radiation shield, although it has not been used for this purpose as much as have lead or  depleted uranium.Thorium may be used in  subcritical reactors instead of uranium as fuel. This produces less waste and cannot melt down.
Applications of  thorium dioxide (ThO2):
 Mantles in portable gas lights. These mantles glow with a dazzling light (unrelated to radioactivity) when heated in a gas flame.Used to control the grain size of tungsten used for electric lamps.Used for high-temperature laboratory  crucibles.Added to glass, it helps create glasses of a high  refractive index and with low  dispersion. Consequently, they find application in high-quality  lenses for cameras and scientific instruments.Has been used as a  catalyst: 
In the conversion of ammonia to  nitric acid.In petroleum  cracking.In producing sulfuric acid.
Thorium dioxide is the active ingredient of  Thorotrast, which was used as part of  X-ray diagnostics. This use has been abandoned due to the  carcinogenic nature of Thorotrast.
 History
Thorium was discovered in 1828 by the Swedish chemist  Jöns Jakob Berzelius, who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. The metal had virtually no uses until the invention of the lantern mantle in 1885.The  crystal bar process (or Iodide process) was discovered by  Anton Eduard van Arkel and  Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925 to produce high-purity metallic thorium.The name ionium was given early in the study of radioactive elements to the 230Th  isotope produced in the  decay chain of  238U before it was realized that ionium and thorium were chemically identical. The symbol Io was used for this supposed element. Occurrence


 Monazite, a rare-earth-and-thorium-phosphate mineral is the primary source of the world's thorium


Thorium is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils, where it is about three times more abundant than uranium, and is about as common as lead. Soil commonly contains an average of around 12 parts per million (ppm) of thorium. Thorium occurs in several minerals, the most common being the rare earth-thorium-phosphate mineral,  monazite, which contains up to about 12% thorium oxide. There are substantial deposits in several countries. 232Th decays very slowly (its  half-life is about three times the age of the earth) but other thorium  isotopes occur in the thorium and uranium decay chains. Most of these are short-lived and hence much more radioactive than 232Th, though on a mass basis they are negligible. Thorium as a nuclear fuel
Thorium, as well as uranium and plutonium, can be used as fuel in a  nuclear reactor. Although not  fissile itself, 232Th will absorb  slow neutrons to produce uranium-233 (233U), which is fissile.

There are substantial deposits in several countries. 232Th decays very slowly (its  half-life is about three times the age of the earth) but other thorium  isotopes occur in the thorium and uranium decay chains. Most of these are short-lived and hence much more radioactive than 232Th, though on a mass basis they are negligible. Thorium as a nuclear fuel
Thorium, as well as uranium and plutonium, can be used as fuel in a  nuclear reactor. Although not  fissile itself, 232Th will absorb  slow neutrons to produce uranium-233 (233U), which is fissile. Hence, like 238U, it is fertile. In one significant respect 233U is better than the other two fissile isotopes used for nuclear fuel, 235U and plutonium-239 (239Pu), because of its higher neutron yield per neutron absorbed. Given a start with some other fissile material (235U or 239Pu), a breeding cycle similar to, but more efficient than that currently possible with the 238U-to-239Pu cycle (in  slow-neutron reactors), can be set up. The 232Th absorbs a neutron to become 233Th which normally decays to protactinium-233 (233Pa) and then 233U. The irradiated fuel can then be unloaded from the reactor, the 233U separated from the thorium (a relatively simple process since it involves chemical instead of isotopic separation), and fed back into another reactor as part of a closed  nuclear fuel cycle.Problems include the high cost of fuel fabrication due partly to the high radioactivity of 233U which is a result of its contamination with traces of the short-lived 232U; the similar problems in recycling thorium due to highly radioactive 228Th; some weapons proliferation risk of 233U; and the technical problems (not yet satisfactorily solved) in reprocessing. Much development work is still required before the thorium fuel cycle can be commercialised, and the effort required seems unlikely while (or where) abundant uranium is available.Nevertheless, the  thorium fuel cycle, with its potential for breeding fuel without the need for  fast neutron reactors, holds considerable potential long-term. Thorium is significantly more abundant than uranium, so it is a key factor in the sustainability of nuclear energy.Australia and India have particularly large reserves of thorium. India has planned its nuclear power program to eventually use thorium exclusively, phasing out uranium as an input material. This ambitious plan uses both fast and thermal  breeder reactors.

 Occurrence


 Monazite, a rare-earth-and-thorium-phosphate mineral is the primary source of the world's thorium


Thorium is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils, where it is about three times more abundant than uranium, and is about as common as lead. Soil commonly contains an average of around 12 parts per million (ppm) of thorium.

The known isotopes of thorium range in  atomic weight from 210  amu (210Th) to 236 amu (236Th). Precautions
Powdered thorium metal is often  pyrophoric and should be handled carefully.Exposure to aerosolized thorium can lead to increased risk of cancers of the  lung,  pancreas and  blood. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of  liver diseases. This element has no known biological role. See also  Thorotrast. In popular culture
