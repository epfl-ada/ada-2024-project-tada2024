The Thrushes,  family Turdidae, are a group of  passerine birds that occur mainly but not exclusively in the  Old World.They are plump, soft plumaged, small to medium sized  insectivores or sometimes omnivores, often feeding on the ground. Many have attractive songs.The taxonomic treatment of this large family has varied significantly in recent years. Traditionally it included the small Old World species, like the Nightingale and  European Robin in the subfamily Saxicolini, ever so often either that group or the whole family is placed in the  Old World flycatcher family  Muscicapidae.This article follows  Handbook of the Birds of the World with edits from Clement & Hathaway, Thrushes (2000), and retains the large thrushes in Turdidae.
