 Professional career


 Tim Henman playing at Wimbledon, 2005


He climbed up the ranks very quickly: in  1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by  1995, among the top 100; and by  1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the  Atlanta Olympics. He was the UK's highest ranked player that year, and won the Most Improved Player trophy at the  ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January  1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months.In  1998, the year in which he reached Wimbledon's semi-finals for the first time, he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. In  1999, Henman married his long-term girlfriend, TV producer  Lucy Heald."Tiger Tim" - as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon diehards (many of whom assemble on  Henman Hill, unofficially named for their hero) - has come close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, bowing out during the semi-final in  1998,  1999,  2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and  2002. In  2000 he reached the fourth round and in  1996,  1997,  2003 and  2004 he was ousted during the quarter-finals.One of the tournaments he has been most successful in is  Queen's Club. He reached the final in  1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras, and went on to reach the final again in  2001 and  2002, where both times he lost to  Lleyton Hewitt.2001 was Tim's best Wimbledon year. He beat  Roger Federer in 4 sets during the quarterfinal and gained a lot of confidence coming into the semis since the latter just took out defending champion Pete Sampras. Tim faced three-time finalist  Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back. Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in Paris against  Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat  Roger Federer and  Andy Roddick on his way to the final.Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round match at the  French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament favorite and runner-up  Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few months later, at the  US Open, losing to eventual champion  Roger Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup.

 Tim Henman during the first round of the  2006 Australian Open, playing  Dmitry Tursunov


.In the  2004 Summer Olympics  tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury.

 Early life
Henman was educated at  Dragon School and  Reed's School. He comes from a sporting family: his father was accomplished at various sports, including tennis. His grandfather and great-grandfather also competed at Wimbledon. Henman supports  Oxford United Football Club and is a keen  golfer.Between the ages of 10 and 17 he was a member of the David Lloyd Slater Squad, where he trained alongside a number of other young British tennis hopefuls. Henman won many titles at many different places some as smaller places as Ilkleys tennis clubWhile still at school, Henman was diagnosed with  osteochondritis, a bone disease (one form of  chondritis). However, he kept playing tennis, and in  1992 won the National Junior titles in singles and doubles, deciding to join the professional tour in  1993.



 Professional career


 Tim Henman playing at Wimbledon, 2005


He climbed up the ranks very quickly: in  1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by  1995, among the top 100; and by  1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the  Atlanta Olympics. He was the UK's highest ranked player that year, and won the Most Improved Player trophy at the  ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January  1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months.In  1998, the year in which he reached Wimbledon's semi-finals for the first time, he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. In  1999, Henman married his long-term girlfriend, TV producer  Lucy Heald."Tiger Tim" - as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon diehards (many of whom assemble on  Henman Hill, unofficially named for their hero) - has come close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, bowing out during the semi-final in  1998,  1999,  2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and  2002. In  2000 he reached the fourth round and in  1996,  1997,  2003 and  2004 he was ousted during the quarter-finals.One of the tournaments he has been most successful in is  Queen's Club. He reached the final in  1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras, and went on to reach the final again in  2001 and  2002, where both times he lost to  Lleyton Hewitt.2001 was Tim's best Wimbledon year. He beat  Roger Federer in 4 sets during the quarterfinal and gained a lot of confidence coming into the semis since the latter just took out defending champion Pete Sampras. Tim faced three-time finalist  Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back. Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in Paris against  Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat  Roger Federer and  Andy Roddick on his way to the final.Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round match at the  French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament favorite and runner-up  Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few months later, at the  US Open, losing to eventual champion  Roger Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup.

 Tim Henman during the first round of the  2006 Australian Open, playing  Dmitry Tursunov


.In the  2004 Summer Olympics  tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in  Indian Wells Masters and  Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them. Masters Series singles finals

"confidence baby , that's what it's all about" Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Henman"




Between the ages of 10 and 17 he was a member of the David Lloyd Slater Squad, where he trained alongside a number of other young British tennis hopefuls. Henman won many titles at many different places some as smaller places as Ilkleys tennis clubWhile still at school, Henman was diagnosed with  osteochondritis, a bone disease (one form of  chondritis). However, he kept playing tennis, and in  1992 won the National Junior titles in singles and doubles, deciding to join the professional tour in  1993.



 Professional career


 Tim Henman playing at Wimbledon, 2005


He climbed up the ranks very quickly: in  1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by  1995, among the top 100; and by  1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the  Atlanta Olympics. He was the UK's highest ranked player that year, and won the Most Improved Player trophy at the  ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January  1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months.In  1998, the year in which he reached Wimbledon's semi-finals for the first time, he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. In  1999, Henman married his long-term girlfriend, TV producer  Lucy Heald."Tiger Tim" - as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon diehards (many of whom assemble on  Henman Hill, unofficially named for their hero) - has come close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, bowing out during the semi-final in  1998,  1999,  2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and  2002. In  2000 he reached the fourth round and in  1996,  1997,  2003 and  2004 he was ousted during the quarter-finals.One of the tournaments he has been most successful in is  Queen's Club. He reached the final in  1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras, and went on to reach the final again in  2001 and  2002, where both times he lost to  Lleyton Hewitt.2001 was Tim's best Wimbledon year. He beat  Roger Federer in 4 sets during the quarterfinal and gained a lot of confidence coming into the semis since the latter just took out defending champion Pete Sampras. Tim faced three-time finalist  Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back. Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in Paris against  Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat  Roger Federer and  Andy Roddick on his way to the final.Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round match at the  French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament favorite and runner-up  Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few months later, at the  US Open, losing to eventual champion  Roger Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup.

 Tim Henman during the first round of the  2006 Australian Open, playing  Dmitry Tursunov


.In the  2004 Summer Olympics  tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in  Indian Wells Masters and  Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them. Masters Series singles finals

 Professional career


 Tim Henman playing at Wimbledon, 2005


He climbed up the ranks very quickly: in  1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by  1995, among the top 100; and by  1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the  Atlanta Olympics. He was the UK's highest ranked player that year, and won the Most Improved Player trophy at the  ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January  1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months.In  1998, the year in which he reached Wimbledon's semi-finals for the first time, he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. In  1999, Henman married his long-term girlfriend, TV producer  Lucy Heald."Tiger Tim" - as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon diehards (many of whom assemble on  Henman Hill, unofficially named for their hero) - has come close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, bowing out during the semi-final in  1998,  1999,  2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and  2002. In  2000 he reached the fourth round and in  1996,  1997,  2003 and  2004 he was ousted during the quarter-finals.One of the tournaments he has been most successful in is  Queen's Club. He reached the final in  1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras, and went on to reach the final again in  2001 and  2002, where both times he lost to  Lleyton Hewitt.2001 was Tim's best Wimbledon year. He beat  Roger Federer in 4 sets during the quarterfinal and gained a lot of confidence coming into the semis since the latter just took out defending champion Pete Sampras. Tim faced three-time finalist  Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back. Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in Paris against  Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat  Roger Federer and  Andy Roddick on his way to the final.Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round match at the  French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament favorite and runner-up  Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few months later, at the  US Open, losing to eventual champion  Roger Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup.

 Tim Henman during the first round of the  2006 Australian Open, playing  Dmitry Tursunov


.In the  2004 Summer Olympics  tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in  Indian Wells Masters and  Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them. Masters Series singles finals

"confidence baby , that's what it's all about" Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Henman"




He climbed up the ranks very quickly: in  1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by  1995, among the top 100; and by  1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the  Atlanta Olympics. He was the UK's highest ranked player that year, and won the Most Improved Player trophy at the  ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January  1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months.In  1998, the year in which he reached Wimbledon's semi-finals for the first time, he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. In  1999, Henman married his long-term girlfriend, TV producer  Lucy Heald."Tiger Tim" - as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon diehards (many of whom assemble on  Henman Hill, unofficially named for their hero) - has come close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, bowing out during the semi-final in  1998,  1999,  2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and  2002. In  2000 he reached the fourth round and in  1996,  1997,  2003 and  2004 he was ousted during the quarter-finals.One of the tournaments he has been most successful in is  Queen's Club. He reached the final in  1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras, and went on to reach the final again in  2001 and  2002, where both times he lost to  Lleyton Hewitt.2001 was Tim's best Wimbledon year. He beat  Roger Federer in 4 sets during the quarterfinal and gained a lot of confidence coming into the semis since the latter just took out defending champion Pete Sampras. Tim faced three-time finalist  Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back. Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in Paris against  Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat  Roger Federer and  Andy Roddick on his way to the final.Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round match at the  French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament favorite and runner-up  Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few months later, at the  US Open, losing to eventual champion  Roger Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup.

 Tim Henman during the first round of the  2006 Australian Open, playing  Dmitry Tursunov


.In the  2004 Summer Olympics  tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in  Indian Wells Masters and  Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them. Masters Series singles finals

"confidence baby , that's what it's all about" Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Henman"




"Tiger Tim" - as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon diehards (many of whom assemble on  Henman Hill, unofficially named for their hero) - has come close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, bowing out during the semi-final in  1998,  1999,  2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and  2002. In  2000 he reached the fourth round and in  1996,  1997,  2003 and  2004 he was ousted during the quarter-finals.One of the tournaments he has been most successful in is  Queen's Club. He reached the final in  1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras, and went on to reach the final again in  2001 and  2002, where both times he lost to  Lleyton Hewitt.2001 was Tim's best Wimbledon year. He beat  Roger Federer in 4 sets during the quarterfinal and gained a lot of confidence coming into the semis since the latter just took out defending champion Pete Sampras. Tim faced three-time finalist  Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back. Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in Paris against  Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat  Roger Federer and  Andy Roddick on his way to the final.Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round match at the  French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament favorite and runner-up  Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few months later, at the  US Open, losing to eventual champion  Roger Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup.

 Tim Henman during the first round of the  2006 Australian Open, playing  Dmitry Tursunov


.In the  2004 Summer Olympics  tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in  Indian Wells Masters and  Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them. Masters Series singles finals

Tim faced three-time finalist  Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back. Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in Paris against  Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat  Roger Federer and  Andy Roddick on his way to the final.Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round match at the  French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament favorite and runner-up  Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few months later, at the  US Open, losing to eventual champion  Roger Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup.

 Tim Henman during the first round of the  2006 Australian Open, playing  Dmitry Tursunov


.In the  2004 Summer Olympics  tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in  Indian Wells Masters and  Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them. Masters Series singles finals

"confidence baby , that's what it's all about" Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Henman"




.In the  2004 Summer Olympics  tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and expected to do well, but lost in the first round.In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in  Indian Wells Masters and  Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them. Masters Series singles finals

In 2005, he lost in straight sets to  Nikolay Davydenko in the third round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the previous year. He went out in the second round at both the  French Open and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to  Luis Horna. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to  Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up; he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been 2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to  Fernando Verdasco.Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against  Lleyton Hewitt on March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006  The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to  Lleyton Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6, 2-6, after a five-set victory over  Robin Soderling of Sweden in the first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury problems.Henman was created an  OBE in the 2003  New Year's Honours List.In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 ( Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to  Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series Events in  Indian Wells Masters and  Miami Masters but lost in the first round in both of them. Masters Series singles finals
