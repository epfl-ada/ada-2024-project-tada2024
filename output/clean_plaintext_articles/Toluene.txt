Toluene, also known as methylbenzene or phenylmethane is a clear,  water-insoluble liquid with the typical smell of  paint thinners, redolent of the sweet smell of the related compound benzene. It is an  aromatic hydrocarbon that is widely used as an industrial  feedstock and as a  solvent.
 History
The name toluene was derived from the older name toluol that refers to  tolu balsam, an aromatic extract from the tropical American tree Myroxylon balsamum, from which it was first isolated. It was originally named by  Jöns Jakob Berzelius. Chemical properties
Toluene reacts as a normal  aromatic hydrocarbon towards  electrophilic aromatic substitution. The  methyl group makes it around 25 times more reactive than benzene in such reactions. It undergoes smooth  sulfonation to give  p-toluenesulfonic acid, and  chlorination by Cl2 in the presence of FeCl3 to give ortho and para  isomers of  chlorotoluene. It undergoes  nitration to give ortho and para  nitrotoluene isomers, but if heated it can give  dinitrotoluene and ultimately the explosive  trinitrotoluene (TNT).With other  reagents the methyl  side chain in toluene may react, undergoing oxidation. Reaction with  potassium permanganate leads to  benzoic acid, whereas reaction with  chromyl chloride leads to  benzaldehyde ( Etard reaction).  Halogenation can be performed under  free radical conditions. For example,  N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) heated with toluene in the presence of  AIBN leads to  benzyl bromide.Catalytic  hydrogenation of toluene to  methylcyclohexane requires a high pressure of hydrogen to go to completion, because of the stability of the aromatic system Preparation
Toluene occurs naturally at low levels in  crude oil and is usually produced in the processes of making  gasoline via a  catalytic reformer, in an  ethylene  cracker or making  coke from coal. Final separation (either via  distillation or solvent  extraction) takes place in a  BTX plant. Uses
Toluene is a common  solvent, able to dissolve:  paints, paint thinners, many  chemical reactants,  rubber,  printing ink,  adhesives (glues),  lacquers,  leather tanners, and  disinfectants. It can also be used as a  fullerene indicator, and is a raw material for  toluene diisocyanate (used in the manufacture of  polyurethane foam),  phenol and  TNT. Toluene can be used as an  octane booster in  gasoline fuels used in  internal combustion engines. Toluene at 84% by volume, fueled all the turbo Formula 1 teams in the 1980s. Small 1.5L turbo engines were known to operate at 5 bar (73 psi) boost in qualifying and 4 bars (59 psi) while racing. More than 1500bhp from 1.5L engines was possible. For proper atomization, the Toluene fuel blend was preheated. Industrial uses of toluene include dealkylation to benzene and disproportionation to a mixture of benzene and  xylene. Toluene can be used to break open  red blood cells in order to extract  haemoglobin in biochemistry experiments. Toxicology and metabolism



Inhalation of toluene fumes can be intoxicating, but in larger doses nausea-inducing.  Chronic or frequent inhalation of toluene over long time periods leads to irreversible  brain damage. Toluene may enter the human system not only through vapour inhalation from the liquid evaporation, but also following  soil contamination events, where human contact with soil, ingestion of contaminated groundwater or soil vapour off-gassing can occur.The toxicity of toluene can be explained mostly by its metabolism. As toluene has very low water solubility, it cannot exit the body via the normal routes (urine, feces, or sweat). It must be metabolized in order to be excreted. The methyl group of toluene is more easily oxidized by  cytochrome P450 than the benzene ring. Therefore, in the metabolism of toluene, 95% is oxidized to become  benzyl alcohol. The toxic metabolites are created by the remaining 5% that are ring oxidized to epoxides. Most of the epoxides become  glutathione conjugated. However, the remainder will severely damage cells.


Toluene is mainly excreted as  benzoic acid and  hippuric acid, both formed by further metabolic oxidation of benzyl alcohol.


 Behavioural Effects of Long Term Exposure
Serious adverse behavioural effects are often associated with toluene abuse related to the deliberate inhalation of solvents.4 Long term toluene exposure is often associated with effects such as:  psychoorganic syndrome;5 visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormality;5 toxic  polyneuropathy, cerebellar,  cognitive, and  pyramidal dysfunctions;5  optic atrophy; and  brain lesions.4Toluene causes postural tremors by increasing extracellular concentrations of  γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) within the  cerebellar cortex.4 Treatment with  GABA agonists such as,  benzodiazepines provide some relief from toluene induced tremor and  ataxia.4 An alternative to drug treatment is  vim thalamotomy.4 The tremors associated with toluene misuse do not seem to be a transient symptom, but an irreversible and progressive symptom which continues after solvent abuse has been discontinued.4There is some evidence that low level toluene exposure may cause disruption in the differentiation of  astrocyte precursor cells.6 This does not appear to be a major hazard to adults; however, exposure of pregnant women to toluene during critical stages of fetal development could cause serious disruption to neuronal development.6 Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene"

Serious adverse behavioural effects are often associated with toluene abuse related to the deliberate inhalation of solvents.4 Long term toluene exposure is often associated with effects such as:  psychoorganic syndrome;5 visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormality;5 toxic  polyneuropathy, cerebellar,  cognitive, and  pyramidal dysfunctions;5  optic atrophy; and  brain lesions.4Toluene causes postural tremors by increasing extracellular concentrations of  γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) within the  cerebellar cortex.4 Treatment with  GABA agonists such as,  benzodiazepines provide some relief from toluene induced tremor and  ataxia.4 An alternative to drug treatment is  vim thalamotomy.4 The tremors associated with toluene misuse do not seem to be a transient symptom, but an irreversible and progressive symptom which continues after solvent abuse has been discontinued.4There is some evidence that low level toluene exposure may cause disruption in the differentiation of  astrocyte precursor cells.6 This does not appear to be a major hazard to adults; however, exposure of pregnant women to toluene during critical stages of fetal development could cause serious disruption to neuronal development.6 Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene"




Toluene occurs naturally at low levels in  crude oil and is usually produced in the processes of making  gasoline via a  catalytic reformer, in an  ethylene  cracker or making  coke from coal. Final separation (either via  distillation or solvent  extraction) takes place in a  BTX plant. Uses
Toluene is a common  solvent, able to dissolve:  paints, paint thinners, many  chemical reactants,  rubber,  printing ink,  adhesives (glues),  lacquers,  leather tanners, and  disinfectants. It can also be used as a  fullerene indicator, and is a raw material for  toluene diisocyanate (used in the manufacture of  polyurethane foam),  phenol and  TNT. Toluene can be used as an  octane booster in  gasoline fuels used in  internal combustion engines. Toluene at 84% by volume, fueled all the turbo Formula 1 teams in the 1980s. Small 1.5L turbo engines were known to operate at 5 bar (73 psi) boost in qualifying and 4 bars (59 psi) while racing. More than 1500bhp from 1.5L engines was possible. For proper atomization, the Toluene fuel blend was preheated. Industrial uses of toluene include dealkylation to benzene and disproportionation to a mixture of benzene and  xylene. Toluene can be used to break open  red blood cells in order to extract  haemoglobin in biochemistry experiments. Toxicology and metabolism



Inhalation of toluene fumes can be intoxicating, but in larger doses nausea-inducing.  Chronic or frequent inhalation of toluene over long time periods leads to irreversible  brain damage. Toluene may enter the human system not only through vapour inhalation from the liquid evaporation, but also following  soil contamination events, where human contact with soil, ingestion of contaminated groundwater or soil vapour off-gassing can occur.The toxicity of toluene can be explained mostly by its metabolism. As toluene has very low water solubility, it cannot exit the body via the normal routes (urine, feces, or sweat). It must be metabolized in order to be excreted. The methyl group of toluene is more easily oxidized by  cytochrome P450 than the benzene ring. Therefore, in the metabolism of toluene, 95% is oxidized to become  benzyl alcohol. The toxic metabolites are created by the remaining 5% that are ring oxidized to epoxides. Most of the epoxides become  glutathione conjugated. However, the remainder will severely damage cells.
