Ununbium ( IPA: /ˌjuːˈnʌnbiəm/), or  eka-mercury, is a temporary  IUPAC  systematic element name for a chemical element in the periodic table that has the  temporary symbol Uub and the  atomic number 112. Element 112 is one of the  superheavy elements. Following periodic trends, it is expected to be a liquid metal more volatile than mercury. History
Ununbium was  first created on  February 9,  1996 at the  Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in  Darmstadt, Germany. This element was created by fusing a zinc atom with a lead atom by accelerating zinc nuclei into a lead target in a heavy  ion accelerator.The element was synthesized in  2000 and  2004 in the  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia.On May  2006 in the  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research the synthesis of this element was confirmed by another method (the chemical identifying on final products of decay of element).Speculation in chemistry circles is that the discoverers will likely propose  helmholtzium with symbol Hh after the HGF consortium. HGF is the acronym for the  Hermann von Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren which is the association of national research centers  GSI is part of. Another suggestion is  wixhausium with symbol  Wi after the Wixhausen district of  Darmstadt. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununbium"
