Ununquadium ( IPA: /ˌjuːˌnʌnˈkwɒdiəm/), or  eka- lead, is the temporary name of a  radioactive chemical element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Uuq and has the  atomic number 114.
 History
The discovery of ununquadium in December  1998 was reported in January  1999 by scientists at  Dubna ( Joint Institute for Nuclear Research) in Russia. The same team produced another isotope of Uuq three months later and confirmed the synthesis in  2004 and  2006.In  2004 in the  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research the synthesis of this element was confirmed by another method (the chemical identifying on final products of decay of element).Ununquadium is a temporary  IUPAC  systematic element name. Some have termed it eka-lead, as its properties are conjectured to be similar to those of lead. It is expected to be a soft, dense metal that tarnishes in air, with a melting point around 200 degrees Celsius. Synthesis
Ununquadium can be synthesized by bombarding plutonium 244 targets with  calcium 48 heavy ion beams. Synthesis of isotope 298
Manufacturing Ununquadium-298 would be very difficult, because nuclei summing to 114 protons and 184 neutrons are not available in weighable quantities.However it may be possible to generate the isotope 298 of Element 114, if nuclear transfer reactions can be achieved. One of these reactions may be: 204Hg + 136Xe → 298Unq + 40Ca + 2n Stable ununquadium
Ununquadium does not occur naturally on the earth—it is entirely synthesized in laboratories. All isotopes of ununquadium synthesized so far are neutron-poor. This means that they contain significantly-fewer neutrons than 184, which is a hypothetical "magic number" of neutrons for greater stability (isotope Uuq-298). Neutron-poor also indicates that the isotopes decay either by spontaneous fission, or by one of the two processes that convert a proton into a neutron, yielding element 113.
