Ununtrium ( IPA: /ˌjuːˈnʌntriəm/), or  eka-thallium, is the temporary name of a  synthetic element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Uut and has the  atomic number 113. It comes from the alpha decay (release of a helium nucleus) of ununpentium. Following periodic trends it is expected to be a soft, silvery highly reactive metal, rather like sodium.
 History
On  February 1,  2004, the discovery of ununtrium and ununpentium were reported by a team composed of Russian scientists at  Dubna ( Joint Institute for Nuclear Research), and American scientists at the  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.On  September 28,  2004, a team of Japanese scientists declared that they succeeded in synthesizing the element. , In May  2006 in the  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research the synthesis of this element was confirmed by another method (the chemical identifying on final products of decay of element). Name
Ununtrium is a temporary  IUPAC  systematic element name. Scientists from Japan proposed for the element the name japonium (symbol Jp) or rikenium (Rk)  . Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununtrium"
