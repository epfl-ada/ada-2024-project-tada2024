Vanadium ( IPA: /vəˈneɪdiəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol V and  atomic number 23. A rare, soft and ductile element, vanadium is found combined in certain minerals and is used mainly to produce certain  alloys. It is one of the 26 elements commonly found in living things.
 Notable characteristics
Vanadium is a soft and ductile, silver-grey metal. It has good resistance to corrosion by  alkalis,  sulfuric and hydrochloric acid. It  oxidizes readily at about 933  K. Vanadium has good structural strength and a low fission neutron cross section, making it useful in nuclear applications. Although a metal, it shares with chromium and manganese the property of having valency oxides with  acid properties.Common  oxidation states of vanadium include +2, +3, +4 and +5. A popular experiment with ammonium vanadate NH4VO3, reducing the compound with zinc metal, can demonstrate colorimetrically all four of these vanadium oxidation states. A +1 oxidation state is rarely seen. Applications
Approximately 80% of vanadium produced is used as  ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. Other uses:
In such  alloys as: 
specialty  stainless steel, e.g. for use in  surgical instruments and  tools. rust resistant and high speed tool steels.mixed with aluminium in titanium alloys used in jet engines and high-speed airframes
Vanadium steel alloys are used in  axles,  crankshafts, gears, and other critical components.It is an important  carbide stabilizer in making steels.Because of its low fission neutron cross section, vanadium has nuclear applications.Vanadium foil is used in  cladding titanium to steel. Vanadium-gallium tape is used in superconducting magnets (175,000  gauss). Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is used as a  catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid (via the  contact process) and  maleic anhydride. It is also used in making  ceramics.Glass coated with  vanadium dioxide VO2 can block  infrared radiation (and not visible light) at a specific temperature. Electrical fuel cells and storage batteries such as  vanadium redox batteries.Added to corundum to make simulated  Alexandrite jewelry. Vanadate  electrochemical conversion coatings for protecting steel against rust and corrosion
 History
Vanadium was originally  discovered by  Andrés Manuel del Río (a Spanish mineralogist) in Mexico City, in  1801. He called it "brown lead" (now named  vanadinite). Through experimentation, its colors reminded him of chromium, so he named the element panchromium. He later renamed this compound erythronium, since most of the salts turned red when heated. The French chemist  Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils incorrectly declared that del Rio's new element was only impure chromium. Del Rio thought himself to be mistaken and accepted the statement of the French chemist that was also backed by Del Rio's friend Baron  Alexander von Humboldt.In  1831,  Sefström of Sweden rediscovered vanadium in a new oxide he found while working with some iron ores and later that same year  Friedrich Wöhler confirmed del Rio's earlier work. Later,  George William Featherstonhaugh, one of the first US geologists, suggested that the element should be named "rionium" after Del Rio, but this never happened.Metallic vanadium was isolated by  Henry Enfield Roscoe in  1867, who reduced  vanadium(III) chloride VCl3 with hydrogen. The name vanadium comes from  Vanadis, a goddess in  Scandinavian mythology, because the element has beautiful multicolored  chemical compounds. Biological role
In biology, a vanadium atom is an essential component of some  enzymes, particularly the vanadium  nitrogenase used by some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms. Vanadium is essential to  ascidians or  sea squirts in  vanadium chromagen proteins. The concentration of vanadium in their blood is more than 100 times higher than the concentration of vanadium in the seawater around them.  Rats and chickens are also known to require vanadium in very small amounts and deficiencies result in reduced growth and impaired  reproduction.Administration of oxovanadium compounds has been shown to alleviate diabetes mellitus symptoms in certain animal models and humans. Much like the chromium effect on sugar metabolism, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Mineral supplement in drinking water
Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is marketed in Japan as a good mineral health supplement naturally occurring in drinking water. The source of this drinking water is mainly the slopes of Mount Fuji. The water's vanadium pentoxide content ranges from about 80 to 130 μg/liter. It is marketed as being effective against diabetes, eczema, and obesity. There is no mention of its toxicity in the marketing of these products. Occurrence
Vanadium is never found unbound in nature but it does occur in about 65 different minerals among which are  patronite VS4,  vanadinite Pb5(VO4)3Cl, and  carnotite K2(UO2)2(VO4)2.3H2O. Vanadium is also present in  bauxite, and in carbon containing deposits such as  crude oil, coal,  oil shale and  tar sands. Vanadium has also been detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and some other stars.Much of the vanadium metal being produced is now made by calcium reduction of  V2O5 in a pressure vessel. Vanadium is usually recovered as a by-product or co-product, and so world resources of the element are not really indicative of available supply. Isolation
Vanadium is available commercially and production of a sample in the  laboratory is not normally required. Commercially, routes leading to metallic vanadium as main product are not usually required as enough is produced as  byproduct in other processes.In industry, heating of vanadium ore or residues from other processes with  salt NaCl or  sodium carbonate Na2CO3 at about 850°C gives sodium vanadate NaVO3. This is dissolved in water and acidified to give a red solid which in turn is melted to form a crude form of  vanadium pentoxide V2O5. Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium. An alternative suitable for small scales is the reduction of vanadium pentachloride VCl5 with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use.Industrially, most vanadium is used as an additive to improve steels. Rather than proceed via pure vanadium metal it is often sufficient to react the crude of vanadium pentoxide V2O5 with crude iron. This produces ferrovanadium suitable for further work. Compounds
 Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is used as a catalyst principally in the production of sulfuric acid. It is the source of vanadium used in the manufacture of ferrovanadium. It can be used as a dye and colour-fixer. Vanadyl sulfate VOSO4, also called vanadium(IV) sulfate oxide hydrate, is used as a relatively controversial  dietary supplement, primarily for increasing insulin levels and  body-building. Whether it works for the latter purpose has not been proven, and there is some evidence that athletes who take it are merely experiencing a  placebo effect. Vanadium(IV) chloride VCl4 is a soluble form of vanadium that is commonly used in the laboratory. V(IV) is the reduced form of V(V), and commonly occurs after  anaerobic respiration by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria. VCl4 reacts violently with water. Toxicity of vanadium compounds
The toxicity of vanadium depends on its physico-chemical state; particularly on its valence state and solubility. Pentavalent VOSO4 has been reported to be more than 5 times as toxic as trivalent V2O3 (Roschin, 1967). Vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. Inhalation exposures to vanadium and vanadium compounds result primarily in adverse effects to the respiratory system (Sax, 1984; ATSDR, 1990). Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation.There is little evidence that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. There is also no evidence that any vanadium compound is carcinogenic; however, very few adequate studies are available for evaluation. Vanadium has not been classified as to carcinogenicity by the U.S. EPA (1991a). Isotopes
Naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable  isotope 51V and one radioactive isotope 50V with a  half-life of 1.5×1017 years. 24 artificial  radioisotopes have been characterized (in the range of  mass number between 40 and 65) with the most stable being 49V with a half-life of 330 days, and 48V with a half-life of 15.9735 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, the majority of them below 10 seconds. In 4 isotopes,  metastable excited states were found (including 2 metastable states for 60V).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 51V is  electron capture. The next most common mode is  beta decay. The primary  decay products before 51V are element 22 (titanium) isotopes and the primary products after are element 24 (chromium) isotopes. Precautions
Powdered metallic vanadium is a fire hazard, and unless known otherwise, all vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic. Generally, the higher the oxidation state of vanadium, the more toxic the compound is. The most dangerous one is  vanadium pentoxide.The  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week.The  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health. This is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death.

V(IV) is the reduced form of V(V), and commonly occurs after  anaerobic respiration by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria. VCl4 reacts violently with water. Toxicity of vanadium compounds
The toxicity of vanadium depends on its physico-chemical state; particularly on its valence state and solubility. Pentavalent VOSO4 has been reported to be more than 5 times as toxic as trivalent V2O3 (Roschin, 1967). Vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. Inhalation exposures to vanadium and vanadium compounds result primarily in adverse effects to the respiratory system (Sax, 1984; ATSDR, 1990). Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation.There is little evidence that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. There is also no evidence that any vanadium compound is carcinogenic; however, very few adequate studies are available for evaluation. Vanadium has not been classified as to carcinogenicity by the U.S. EPA (1991a). Isotopes
Naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable  isotope 51V and one radioactive isotope 50V with a  half-life of 1.5×1017 years. 24 artificial  radioisotopes have been characterized (in the range of  mass number between 40 and 65) with the most stable being 49V with a half-life of 330 days, and 48V with a half-life of 15.9735 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, the majority of them below 10 seconds. In 4 isotopes,  metastable excited states were found (including 2 metastable states for 60V).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 51V is  electron capture. The next most common mode is  beta decay. The primary  decay products before 51V are element 22 (titanium) isotopes and the primary products after are element 24 (chromium) isotopes. Precautions
Powdered metallic vanadium is a fire hazard, and unless known otherwise, all vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic. Generally, the higher the oxidation state of vanadium, the more toxic the compound is. The most dangerous one is  vanadium pentoxide.The  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week.The  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health. This is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death.

 Applications
Approximately 80% of vanadium produced is used as  ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. Other uses:
In such  alloys as: 
specialty  stainless steel, e.g. for use in  surgical instruments and  tools. rust resistant and high speed tool steels.mixed with aluminium in titanium alloys used in jet engines and high-speed airframes
Vanadium steel alloys are used in  axles,  crankshafts, gears, and other critical components.It is an important  carbide stabilizer in making steels.Because of its low fission neutron cross section, vanadium has nuclear applications.Vanadium foil is used in  cladding titanium to steel. Vanadium-gallium tape is used in superconducting magnets (175,000  gauss). Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is used as a  catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid (via the  contact process) and  maleic anhydride. It is also used in making  ceramics.Glass coated with  vanadium dioxide VO2 can block  infrared radiation (and not visible light) at a specific temperature. Electrical fuel cells and storage batteries such as  vanadium redox batteries.Added to corundum to make simulated  Alexandrite jewelry. Vanadate  electrochemical conversion coatings for protecting steel against rust and corrosion
 History
Vanadium was originally  discovered by  Andrés Manuel del Río (a Spanish mineralogist) in Mexico City, in  1801. He called it "brown lead" (now named  vanadinite). Through experimentation, its colors reminded him of chromium, so he named the element panchromium. He later renamed this compound erythronium, since most of the salts turned red when heated. The French chemist  Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils incorrectly declared that del Rio's new element was only impure chromium. Del Rio thought himself to be mistaken and accepted the statement of the French chemist that was also backed by Del Rio's friend Baron  Alexander von Humboldt.In  1831,  Sefström of Sweden rediscovered vanadium in a new oxide he found while working with some iron ores and later that same year  Friedrich Wöhler confirmed del Rio's earlier work. Later,  George William Featherstonhaugh, one of the first US geologists, suggested that the element should be named "rionium" after Del Rio, but this never happened.Metallic vanadium was isolated by  Henry Enfield Roscoe in  1867, who reduced  vanadium(III) chloride VCl3 with hydrogen. The name vanadium comes from  Vanadis, a goddess in  Scandinavian mythology, because the element has beautiful multicolored  chemical compounds. Biological role
In biology, a vanadium atom is an essential component of some  enzymes, particularly the vanadium  nitrogenase used by some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms. Vanadium is essential to  ascidians or  sea squirts in  vanadium chromagen proteins. The concentration of vanadium in their blood is more than 100 times higher than the concentration of vanadium in the seawater around them.  Rats and chickens are also known to require vanadium in very small amounts and deficiencies result in reduced growth and impaired  reproduction.Administration of oxovanadium compounds has been shown to alleviate diabetes mellitus symptoms in certain animal models and humans. Much like the chromium effect on sugar metabolism, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Mineral supplement in drinking water
Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is marketed in Japan as a good mineral health supplement naturally occurring in drinking water. The source of this drinking water is mainly the slopes of Mount Fuji. The water's vanadium pentoxide content ranges from about 80 to 130 μg/liter. It is marketed as being effective against diabetes, eczema, and obesity. There is no mention of its toxicity in the marketing of these products. Occurrence
Vanadium is never found unbound in nature but it does occur in about 65 different minerals among which are  patronite VS4,  vanadinite Pb5(VO4)3Cl, and  carnotite K2(UO2)2(VO4)2.3H2O. Vanadium is also present in  bauxite, and in carbon containing deposits such as  crude oil, coal,  oil shale and  tar sands. Vanadium has also been detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and some other stars.Much of the vanadium metal being produced is now made by calcium reduction of  V2O5 in a pressure vessel. Vanadium is usually recovered as a by-product or co-product, and so world resources of the element are not really indicative of available supply. Isolation
Vanadium is available commercially and production of a sample in the  laboratory is not normally required. Commercially, routes leading to metallic vanadium as main product are not usually required as enough is produced as  byproduct in other processes.In industry, heating of vanadium ore or residues from other processes with  salt NaCl or  sodium carbonate Na2CO3 at about 850°C gives sodium vanadate NaVO3. This is dissolved in water and acidified to give a red solid which in turn is melted to form a crude form of  vanadium pentoxide V2O5. Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium. An alternative suitable for small scales is the reduction of vanadium pentachloride VCl5 with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use.Industrially, most vanadium is used as an additive to improve steels. Rather than proceed via pure vanadium metal it is often sufficient to react the crude of vanadium pentoxide V2O5 with crude iron. This produces ferrovanadium suitable for further work. Compounds
 Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is used as a catalyst principally in the production of sulfuric acid. It is the source of vanadium used in the manufacture of ferrovanadium. It can be used as a dye and colour-fixer. Vanadyl sulfate VOSO4, also called vanadium(IV) sulfate oxide hydrate, is used as a relatively controversial  dietary supplement, primarily for increasing insulin levels and  body-building. Whether it works for the latter purpose has not been proven, and there is some evidence that athletes who take it are merely experiencing a  placebo effect.

This is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death.
Metallic vanadium was isolated by  Henry Enfield Roscoe in  1867, who reduced  vanadium(III) chloride VCl3 with hydrogen. The name vanadium comes from  Vanadis, a goddess in  Scandinavian mythology, because the element has beautiful multicolored  chemical compounds. Biological role
In biology, a vanadium atom is an essential component of some  enzymes, particularly the vanadium  nitrogenase used by some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms. Vanadium is essential to  ascidians or  sea squirts in  vanadium chromagen proteins. The concentration of vanadium in their blood is more than 100 times higher than the concentration of vanadium in the seawater around them.  Rats and chickens are also known to require vanadium in very small amounts and deficiencies result in reduced growth and impaired  reproduction.Administration of oxovanadium compounds has been shown to alleviate diabetes mellitus symptoms in certain animal models and humans. Much like the chromium effect on sugar metabolism, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Mineral supplement in drinking water
Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is marketed in Japan as a good mineral health supplement naturally occurring in drinking water. The source of this drinking water is mainly the slopes of Mount Fuji. The water's vanadium pentoxide content ranges from about 80 to 130 μg/liter. It is marketed as being effective against diabetes, eczema, and obesity. There is no mention of its toxicity in the marketing of these products. Occurrence
Vanadium is never found unbound in nature but it does occur in about 65 different minerals among which are  patronite VS4,  vanadinite Pb5(VO4)3Cl, and  carnotite K2(UO2)2(VO4)2.3H2O. Vanadium is also present in  bauxite, and in carbon containing deposits such as  crude oil, coal,  oil shale and  tar sands. Vanadium has also been detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and some other stars.Much of the vanadium metal being produced is now made by calcium reduction of  V2O5 in a pressure vessel. Vanadium is usually recovered as a by-product or co-product, and so world resources of the element are not really indicative of available supply. Isolation
Vanadium is available commercially and production of a sample in the  laboratory is not normally required. Commercially, routes leading to metallic vanadium as main product are not usually required as enough is produced as  byproduct in other processes.In industry, heating of vanadium ore or residues from other processes with  salt NaCl or  sodium carbonate Na2CO3 at about 850°C gives sodium vanadate NaVO3. This is dissolved in water and acidified to give a red solid which in turn is melted to form a crude form of  vanadium pentoxide V2O5. Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium. An alternative suitable for small scales is the reduction of vanadium pentachloride VCl5 with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use.Industrially, most vanadium is used as an additive to improve steels. Rather than proceed via pure vanadium metal it is often sufficient to react the crude of vanadium pentoxide V2O5 with crude iron. This produces ferrovanadium suitable for further work. Compounds
 Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is used as a catalyst principally in the production of sulfuric acid. It is the source of vanadium used in the manufacture of ferrovanadium. It can be used as a dye and colour-fixer. Vanadyl sulfate VOSO4, also called vanadium(IV) sulfate oxide hydrate, is used as a relatively controversial  dietary supplement, primarily for increasing insulin levels and  body-building. Whether it works for the latter purpose has not been proven, and there is some evidence that athletes who take it are merely experiencing a  placebo effect. Vanadium(IV) chloride VCl4 is a soluble form of vanadium that is commonly used in the laboratory. V(IV) is the reduced form of V(V), and commonly occurs after  anaerobic respiration by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria. VCl4 reacts violently with water. Toxicity of vanadium compounds
The toxicity of vanadium depends on its physico-chemical state; particularly on its valence state and solubility. Pentavalent VOSO4 has been reported to be more than 5 times as toxic as trivalent V2O3 (Roschin, 1967). Vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. Inhalation exposures to vanadium and vanadium compounds result primarily in adverse effects to the respiratory system (Sax, 1984; ATSDR, 1990). Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation.There is little evidence that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. There is also no evidence that any vanadium compound is carcinogenic; however, very few adequate studies are available for evaluation. Vanadium has not been classified as to carcinogenicity by the U.S. EPA (1991a). Isotopes
Naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable  isotope 51V and one radioactive isotope 50V with a  half-life of 1.5×1017 years. 24 artificial  radioisotopes have been characterized (in the range of  mass number between 40 and 65) with the most stable being 49V with a half-life of 330 days, and 48V with a half-life of 15.9735 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, the majority of them below 10 seconds. In 4 isotopes,  metastable excited states were found (including 2 metastable states for 60V).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 51V is  electron capture. The next most common mode is  beta decay. The primary  decay products before 51V are element 22 (titanium) isotopes and the primary products after are element 24 (chromium) isotopes. Precautions
Powdered metallic vanadium is a fire hazard, and unless known otherwise, all vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic. Generally, the higher the oxidation state of vanadium, the more toxic the compound is. The most dangerous one is  vanadium pentoxide.The  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week.The  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health.

This is dissolved in water and acidified to give a red solid which in turn is melted to form a crude form of  vanadium pentoxide V2O5. Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium. An alternative suitable for small scales is the reduction of vanadium pentachloride VCl5 with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use.Industrially, most vanadium is used as an additive to improve steels. Rather than proceed via pure vanadium metal it is often sufficient to react the crude of vanadium pentoxide V2O5 with crude iron. This produces ferrovanadium suitable for further work. Compounds
 Vanadium pentoxide V2O5 is used as a catalyst principally in the production of sulfuric acid. It is the source of vanadium used in the manufacture of ferrovanadium. It can be used as a dye and colour-fixer. Vanadyl sulfate VOSO4, also called vanadium(IV) sulfate oxide hydrate, is used as a relatively controversial  dietary supplement, primarily for increasing insulin levels and  body-building. Whether it works for the latter purpose has not been proven, and there is some evidence that athletes who take it are merely experiencing a  placebo effect. Vanadium(IV) chloride VCl4 is a soluble form of vanadium that is commonly used in the laboratory. V(IV) is the reduced form of V(V), and commonly occurs after  anaerobic respiration by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria. VCl4 reacts violently with water. Toxicity of vanadium compounds
The toxicity of vanadium depends on its physico-chemical state; particularly on its valence state and solubility. Pentavalent VOSO4 has been reported to be more than 5 times as toxic as trivalent V2O3 (Roschin, 1967). Vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. Inhalation exposures to vanadium and vanadium compounds result primarily in adverse effects to the respiratory system (Sax, 1984; ATSDR, 1990). Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation.There is little evidence that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. There is also no evidence that any vanadium compound is carcinogenic; however, very few adequate studies are available for evaluation. Vanadium has not been classified as to carcinogenicity by the U.S. EPA (1991a). Isotopes
Naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable  isotope 51V and one radioactive isotope 50V with a  half-life of 1.5×1017 years. 24 artificial  radioisotopes have been characterized (in the range of  mass number between 40 and 65) with the most stable being 49V with a half-life of 330 days, and 48V with a half-life of 15.9735 days. All of the remaining  radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, the majority of them below 10 seconds. In 4 isotopes,  metastable excited states were found (including 2 metastable states for 60V).The primary  decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 51V is  electron capture. The next most common mode is  beta decay. The primary  decay products before 51V are element 22 (titanium) isotopes and the primary products after are element 24 (chromium) isotopes. Precautions
Powdered metallic vanadium is a fire hazard, and unless known otherwise, all vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic. Generally, the higher the oxidation state of vanadium, the more toxic the compound is. The most dangerous one is  vanadium pentoxide.The  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week.The  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health. This is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death.
