The WTA Tour Championships is a tennis tournament played annually at the end of the season for the top-ranked players on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour.
The championships were held for the first time in 1972 at Boca Raton, Florida ( USA ). From 1972- 1986, the event was held in March. The WTA then decided to adopt a January-to-November playing season, and so the event was switched to being held at the end of each year. Because of this changeover, two championships were held in 1986. From 1979- 2000, the event was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City . The event then briefly moved to Germany ( 2001). More recently, it has been held in Los Angeles, California ( 2002- 2005). The 2006 edition was held in Madrid , Spain , the site of the 2007 tournament as well.
From 1972- 1994, the event was known as the Virginia Slims Championships . Since then it has been officially known by the names of other sponsors (it was called the Chase Championships for a few years in the late-1990s), but is more commonly referred to as the "WTA Tour Championships".
From 1984- 1998, the final of the championships was a best-of-five-set match â€“ making it the only tournament on the women's tour to have a best-of-five-set match at any round of the competition. In 1999, the final was reverted to being a best-of-three-set match.
The WTA Tour Championships are generally considered to be the fifth most prestigious event on the women's tour after the four Grand Slam tournaments.
