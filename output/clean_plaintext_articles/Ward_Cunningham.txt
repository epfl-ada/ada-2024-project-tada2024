Howard G. "Ward" Cunningham (born  May 26,  1949) is the American  computer programmer who  invented the  wiki. A pioneer in both  design patterns and  Extreme Programming, he started programming the software  WikiWikiWeb in 1994 and installed it on the  website of his software consultancy, Cunningham & Cunningham (commonly known by its domain name, c2.com), on  March 25,  1995, as an add-on to the  Portland Pattern Repository.Cunningham currently lives in  Beaverton, Oregon.
 Personal history
Howard G. "Ward" Cunningham received his  bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary engineering (electrical engineering and computer science) and his  master's degree in computer science from  Purdue University. He is a founder of Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc. He has also served as Director of R&D at  Wyatt Software and as Principal Engineer in the  Tektronix Computer Research Laboratory. He is founder of the  Hillside Group and has served as program chair of the Pattern Languages of Programs conference which it sponsors. Ward was part of the  Smalltalk community. From December 2003 until October 2005 he worked for  Microsoft Corporation in the "patterns & practices" group. As of October 2005, he is the Director of Committer Community Development at the  Eclipse Foundation. Ideas and inventions
Cunningham is well-known for a few widely disseminated ideas which he originated and developed. Among these, the most famous are the wiki (named after  WikiWikiWeb), and many patterns in the field of software patterns, including the collection of patterns and practices that later became known as "Extreme Programming" or "XP." Patterns and Extreme Programming
Cunningham is also well known for his contributions to the developing practice of  object-oriented programming: in particular, the use of  pattern languages, and  CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration) cards (with  Kent Beck). He is also a significant contributor to  Extreme Programming, a  software development methodology. A great deal of this work was carried out in the first wiki site itself. His most famous quote is probably, "What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?" Or, it could be, "What's the simplest thing that would definitely work?" The underlying theme in both of these is SIMPLE. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham"
