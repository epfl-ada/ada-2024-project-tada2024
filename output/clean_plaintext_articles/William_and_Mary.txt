The phrase William and Mary usually refers to the joint sovereignty over the  Kingdom of England, as well the  Kingdom of Scotland, of King William III and his wife Queen Mary II. Their joint reign began in February, 1689, when they were called to the throne by Parliament, replacing James II, who was "deemed to have fled" the country in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. After Mary died in 1694, William ruled alone until his death in 1702. Their rule was the only period in British history in which "joint sovereigns" with equal powers were allowed to reign; usually, the spouse of the monarch has no power and is simply a  consort.The  College of William and Mary in  Williamsburg, Virginia was chartered in  1693, endowed and named in their honour.
