Woodruff (Galium odoratum) is a  herbaceous  perennial plant in the family  Rubiaceae, native to Europe, western Asia and north Africa. It grows to 30-50 cm long, often lying flat on the ground or supported other plants. The plant is also known in English as Sweetscented bedstraw, Sweet Woodruff, Wild Baby's Breath, Cudweed (G. triflorum), Master of the woods (prob transliteration), and Ladies Bedstraw.The  leaves are simple, lanceolate, glabrous, 2-5 cm long, and borne in whorls of 6-9. The small (4-7 mm diameter) flowers are produced in  cymes, each white with four petals joined together at the base. The seeds are 2-4 mm diameter, produced singly, and each seed is covered in tiny hooked bristles which help disperse the seed by sticking temporarily to clothing and animal fur.This plant prefers partial to full shade in moist, rich soils. In dry summers it needs frequent irrigation. Propagation is by crown division, separation of the rooted stems, or digging up of the barely submerged perimeter  stolons. Uses


 Woodruff – from Thomé, Flora von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz 1885


Woodruff, as the scientific name odoratum suggests, is a strongly scented plant, the sweet scent being derived from  coumarin. This scent increases on wilting and then persists on drying, and woodruff is used in  pot-pourri and as a  moth deterrent. It is also used, mainly in Germany, to flavour wine ( Maiwein), beer ( Berliner Weisse),  brandy,  sausages and  jam, and to make a  herbal tea with gentle  sedative properties.High doses can cause headaches, and very high doses (far beyond those found in the afore-mentioned drinks) can even have mind-altering properties, as well as vertigo, somnolence or even central paralysis and apnoea while in a coma; so, some common sense should be applied when consuming woodruff. Three  grams of woodruff per  litre of Maiwein is considered safe in Germany.
