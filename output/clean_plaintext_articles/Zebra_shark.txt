The zebra shark, Stegostoma fasciatum, is a common  carpet shark of inshore  Indo-Pacific waters notable for its very long  caudal fin, nearly as long as its body. It is the only  species in the  family Stegostomatidae and the  genus Stegostoma.
 Naming
The species is also mistaken for the  leopard shark, a name which can refer to either of the species Stegostoma fasciatum or Triakis semifasciata which is a totally different shark from the eastern pacific. The name zebra shark is given because as a  juvenile the shark have stripes like the zebra, when it grows up it turns into  leopard-like spots. It is a very sleek and skinny shark, about 11.5 feet long. Distribution and habitat
The zebra shark is found in the tropical Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean at depths of about 5 to 30 meters. Anatomy and appearance
In addition to the long tail, the zebra shark has distinctive ridges running down its body. As its names suggest, it is patterned; young sharks are dark with yellowish stripes, changing to an adult pattern of a tan colour with dark spots, found all over including the fins. The snout is rather rounded, with small  barbels (whiskers). Maximum known length is about 230 cm. Behaviour
The zebra shark is a slow-moving type, often just sitting on the seafloor in the vicinity of  coral reefs, on sandy or rocky bottoms. Unlike most types of sharks, it does not need to move, and instead pumps water through its gills. Diet
It feeds on  molluscs, crustaceans, and small fish that it sucks out of the sand at night, and is capable of wiggling through small holes and crevices in its search for food. Importance to humans
Zebra sharks do well in captivity, and a number of aquariums around the world have them on display. They are fished commercially on a small scale. They are often seen by  scuba divers, and will lay still on the bottom as long as a diver does not come too close. They are harmless to divers as long as they are not disturbed.
