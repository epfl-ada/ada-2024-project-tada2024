Zinc chloride is the name of  chemical compound ZnCl2 or its hydrates. All zinc chlorides are colorless or white and highly soluble in water. ZnCl2 itself is  hygroscopic and can be considered  deliquescent. Samples should therefore be protected from sources of moisture, such as the atmosphere.Four crystalline forms of ZnCl2 and its hydrates are known, although the anhydrous form appears to exist only in the hexagonal close-packed phase. Rapid cooling of molten ZnCl2 forms a glassy material.Concentrated aqueous solutions of zinc chloride have the interesting property of dissolving  starch,  silk, and  cellulose. Thus, solutions of zinc chlorides cannot be filtered through standard filter papers.Zinc chloride finds wide application in textile processing,  metallurgical fluxes and chemical synthesis.
 Chemical properties
ZnCl2 is an  ionic solid, although some  covalent character is indicated by its low  melting point (275 °C). Further evidence for covalency is provided by its high solubility in solvents such as  diethyl ether. ZnCl2 is a mild  Lewis acid. Consistent with this character, aqueous solutions of ZnCl2 have a  pH around 4. It is hydrolyzed to an oxychloride when hydrated forms are heated.In aqueous solution, zinc chloride is a useful source of Zn2+ for the preparation of other zinc salts, for example  zinc carbonate:
ZnCl2( aq) +  Na2CO3( aq) →  ZnCO3( s) + 2  NaCl( aq)
 Preparation and purification
Anhydrous ZnCl2 can be prepared from zinc and  hydrogen chloride.
Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl2 + H2
Hydrated forms and aqueous solutions may be readily prepared using concentrated hydrochloric acid and pieces of Zn. Zinc oxide and  zinc sulfide react with HCl, without forming hydrogen:
ZnS( s) + 2 HCl( aq) → ZnCl2( aq) +  H2S( l)
Commercial samples of zinc chloride typically contain water and  zinc oxychloride, the main  hydrolysis product. Such samples may be purified as follows: 100 g of crude ZnCl2 are heated to reflux in 800 mL anhydrous  dioxan in the presence of zinc metal dust. The mixture is filtered while hot (to remove Zn),and then the filtrate is allowed to cool to give pure ZnCl2 as a white precipitate. Anhydrous samples can be purified by  sublimation in a stream of  hydrogen chloride gas, followed by heating to 400 °C in a stream of dry nitrogen gas. Uses
ZnCl2 is used as a  flux for  soldering because of its ability (when molten) to dissolve metal oxides. Typically this flux was prepared by dissolving zinc foil in dilute hydrochloric acid until the liquid ceased to evolve hydrogen, for this reason such flux was known as  killed spirits. because of its corrosive nature it is not a suitable flux for situations where any residue cannot be cleaned totally away, such as electronic work. This property also leads to its use in the manufacture of  magnesia cements for  dental fillings and certain  mouthwashes as an active ingredient. ZnCl2 has also been used as a fireproofing agent, for etching metals, and is also a primary ingredient in fabric refresheners such as Febreze.In the laboratory, zinc chloride finds wide use, principally as a moderate-strength  Lewis acid. It can  catalyse (A) the  Fischer indole synthesis, and also (B)  Friedel-Crafts acylation reactions involving activated  aromatic rings.Related to the latter is the classical preparation of the dye  fluorescein from  phthalic anhydride and  resorcinol, which involves a  Friedel-Crafts acylation. This transformation has in fact been accomplished using even the wet ZnCl2 sample shown in the picture above.Hydrochloric acid alone reacts poorly with  primary alcohols and  secondary alcohols, but a combination of HCl with ZnCl2 (known together as the "Lucas reagent") is effective for the preparation of alkyl chlorides. Typical reactions are conducted at 130 °C. This reaction probably proceeds via an  SN2 mechanism with primary alcohols but  SN1 pathway with secondary alcohols.Zinc chloride also activates  benzylic and  allylic halides towards substitution by weak  nucleophiles such as  alkenes:In similar fashion, ZnCl2 promotes selective  NaBH3CN reduction of tertiary, allylic or benzylic halides to the corresponding hydrocarbons.Zinc chloride is also a useful starting reagent for the synthesis of many  organozinc reagents, such as those used in the palladium catalysed  Negishi coupling with  aryl halides or  vinyl halides. In such cases the organozinc compound is usually prepared by  transmetallation from an  organolithium or a  Grignard reagent, for example:Zinc  enolates, prepared from alkali metal enolates and ZnCl2, provide control of  stereochemistry in  aldol condensation reactions due to  chelation on to the zinc. In the example shown below, the  threo product was favored over the  erythro by a factor of 5:1 when ZnCl2 in  DME/ ether was used. The chelate is more stable when the bulky phenyl group is pseudo- equatorial rather than pseudo- axial, i.e., threo rather than erythro. Precautions

In the example shown below, the  threo product was favored over the  erythro by a factor of 5:1 when ZnCl2 in  DME/ ether was used.

Anhydrous ZnCl2 can be prepared from zinc and  hydrogen chloride.
Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl2 + H2
Hydrated forms and aqueous solutions may be readily prepared using concentrated hydrochloric acid and pieces of Zn. Zinc oxide and  zinc sulfide react with HCl, without forming hydrogen:
ZnS( s) + 2 HCl( aq) → ZnCl2( aq) +  H2S( l)
Commercial samples of zinc chloride typically contain water and  zinc oxychloride, the main  hydrolysis product. Such samples may be purified as follows: 100 g of crude ZnCl2 are heated to reflux in 800 mL anhydrous  dioxan in the presence of zinc metal dust. The mixture is filtered while hot (to remove Zn),and then the filtrate is allowed to cool to give pure ZnCl2 as a white precipitate. Anhydrous samples can be purified by  sublimation in a stream of  hydrogen chloride gas, followed by heating to 400 °C in a stream of dry nitrogen gas. Uses
ZnCl2 is used as a  flux for  soldering because of its ability (when molten) to dissolve metal oxides. Typically this flux was prepared by dissolving zinc foil in dilute hydrochloric acid until the liquid ceased to evolve hydrogen, for this reason such flux was known as  killed spirits. because of its corrosive nature it is not a suitable flux for situations where any residue cannot be cleaned totally away, such as electronic work. This property also leads to its use in the manufacture of  magnesia cements for  dental fillings and certain  mouthwashes as an active ingredient. ZnCl2 has also been used as a fireproofing agent, for etching metals, and is also a primary ingredient in fabric refresheners such as Febreze.In the laboratory, zinc chloride finds wide use, principally as a moderate-strength  Lewis acid. It can  catalyse (A) the  Fischer indole synthesis, and also (B)  Friedel-Crafts acylation reactions involving activated  aromatic rings.Related to the latter is the classical preparation of the dye  fluorescein from  phthalic anhydride and  resorcinol, which involves a  Friedel-Crafts acylation.
